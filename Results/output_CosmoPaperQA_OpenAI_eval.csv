Which corrections in polarization spectra were implemented in the 2018 Planck analysis? ,"In the 2018 Planck analysis, corrections to the polarization spectra included:

1. **Beam-leakage correction**: This correction addressed temperature-to-polarization leakage caused by beam mismatch. It utilized polarized beam matrices computed with the QuickPol code and was based on fiducial theoretical spectra from the best-fit ΛCDM cosmology. The correction had a more significant impact on the T E spectra compared to the EE spectra, resulting in shifts of <∼ 1σ for various parameters when constraining with TT, TE, EE data.

2. **Effective polarization efficiencies**: The effective polarization efficiencies of the SRoll maps were estimated by comparing frequency polarization power spectra to fiducial spectra from the best-fit base-ΛCDM model. This led to relatively small shifts in the base-ΛCDM parameters, with the largest shifts being +0.4σ for ωb, +0.2σ for ωc, and +0.2σ for ns.

Why is there an apparent preference for A_L deviating from theoretical expectations in the Planck 2018 analysis?,"The apparent preference for A_L deviating from theoretical expectations in the Planck 2018 analysis is primarily due to a combination of factors related to the CMB power spectrum data. Specifically, the preference for A_L > 1 within the ΛCDM model is noted as a significant feature, with over half of the upward shift in A_L compared to 2015 being attributed to a lower optical depth (τ) from the 2018 low-` likelihood. This lower τ necessitates a lower amplitude of scalar perturbations (A_s) to match the high-` CMB fluctuation amplitude, resulting in a larger A_L to maintain the lensing amplitude and smoothing consistent with previous findings. In polarization data, about 40% of the shift in A_L is also explained by changes in τ, alongside adjustments for beam leakage and polarization efficiencies.

Moreover, the high-` temperature likelihood indicates a preference for more lensing smoothing than what is allowed by the ΛCDM model, as evidenced by oscillatory residuals in the data that align with the lensing smoothing pattern. The improvement in the best fit by adding an oscillatory residual with A_L ≈ 1.1 suggests that this preference is not merely a statistical fluctuation but could indicate new physics affecting theoretical predictions. Such new physics might mimic the lensing smoothing effect observed in the CMB peaks, as any isotropic change in the amplitude of small-scale features would minimally impact the lensing reconstruction, which is more sensitive to the scale and shape of the peaks rather than their amplitude.","In temperature, over half of the small upward shift in A_L is explained by the lower optical depth from the 2018 low-l likelihood, In polarization, the shift in A_L is explained by changes in \tau, with changes in the maps, modelling for beam leakage, and polarization efficiencies.",Same,0.949938419937544,CORRECT,y,1,1

To correct for this, the true masses are multiplied by a hydrostatic mass bias factor of (1 − b).

Why are BAO measurements utilised with such significance in Planck papers?,"BAO measurements are utilized with significant importance in Planck papers because they serve as the primary non-CMB astrophysical data set, providing a robust geometrical test of cosmology. The acoustic scale measured by BAOs, approximately 147 Mpc, is much larger than the scale of virialized structures, which makes BAO measurements insensitive to nonlinear physics.

This discrepancy highlights a tension between the base ΛCDM model and the SH0ES measurement, suggesting a need for independent distance scale measurements.

What are the sources of the differences between the \lambdaCDM parameters between Planck 2015 and 2018?,"The differences in the ΛCDM parameters between the Planck 2015 and 2018 releases are primarily due to two main effects:

1. **New Polarization Low-` Likelihood**: The introduction of the new HFI low-` polarization likelihood in 2018, replacing the 2015 LFI likelihood, is the largest contributor to the shifts in parameters. This change led to a decrease in the constraint on τ, which caused a 1σ decrease in ln(1010As) due to the Ase−2τ degeneracy. Consequently, this reduced the gravitational lensing smoothing at high multipoles, necessitating an increase of about 1σ in ωc to compensate. This adjustment decreased the amplitude of the first acoustic peak, resulting in a shift of ns to a lower value by about 0.5σ. Further adjustments were made to θ∗ and ωb, each by about 0.5σ.

2. **Polarization Corrections in the High-` Likelihood**: Significant changes also arose from corrections applied to the polarization spectra. Notably, there was a shift towards larger values in ωb by around 1σ, primarily due to the beam-leakage correction in the TE high-` likelihood. This correction also led to an increase of approximately 0.5σ in ns, which compensated for the shift in ns resulting from the change in τ since 2015. Additionally, the beam-leakage correction affected ωc (decreasing it by −0.7σ) and θMC (increasing it by +0.7σ).

What surprising behaviour did the CAMELS autoencoder exhibit after training?,"The surprising behavior exhibited by the CAMELS autoencoder after training was its ability to reconstruct temperature fields from different astrophysical models, despite the expectation that these models (like very efficient AGN or supernova feedback) would produce distinct morphologies that the autoencoder might struggle to replicate. This indicates that the simulations with the fiducial model provided a sufficiently rich set of images, allowing the autoencoder to identify a lower dimension manifold capable of embedding maps from various cosmological and astrophysical models.","Even though the autoencoder was trained on temperature maps with fixed cosmology/astrophysics, it was able to accurately reconstruct temperature fields with different cosmologies/astrophysics.",Same,0.911184687211245,CORRECT,y,1,1

What are the main limitations of the CAMELS simulations?,"The main limitations of the CAMELS simulations are as follows:

1. **Mass and Spatial Resolution**: CAMELS cannot resolve scales below approximately 1 h⁻¹ kpc, and only halos with dark matter mass above 6.5 × 10⁹(Ωm − Ωb)/0.251 h⁻¹ M⊙ contain at least 100 dark matter particles. This restricts the ability to study small-scale structures like sub-halos in the Milky Way, which are crucial for understanding the nature of dark matter.

2. **Simulation Volume**: The volume of the simulations is relatively small at (25 h⁻¹ Mpc)³. This limitation means that long wavelength modes, which are significant for the formation of large structures such as galaxy clusters and for normalizing the matter power spectrum across all scales, are not adequately represented.

3. **Parameter Variation**: CAMELS is restricted to variations of only two cosmological parameters and four astrophysical parameters. For instance, in the (magneto-)hydrodynamic simulations, while Ωm is varied, Ωb is fixed, preventing the separation of effects that depend on the ratio Ωb/Ωm from those of varying Ωm alone. Ideally, a broader range of cosmological parameters (e.g., h, ns, Mν, and w) should be varied in simulations with larger volumes to allow for a more comprehensive analysis of cosmological data.",The mass and spatial resolution in CAMELS does not allow for resolution of scales below \approx 1 h^{−1}kpc.

This is notable because it demonstrates that specific galaxy properties, such as stellar mass, stellar metallicity, and maximum circular velocity, are crucial for determining \( \Omega_m \). The findings suggest that variations in \( \Omega_m \) influence the dark matter content of galaxies, which in turn leaves a distinct signature in their properties, thereby establishing a direct link between cosmology and astrophysics.","The neural network provides evidence showing that the value of \Omega_m can be inferred from the properties of individual galaxies, for the vast majority of the cases.

As the paper explains, at fixed stellar mass, the maximum circular velocity (V_{max}) increases monotonically with \( \Omega_m \). This relationship arises because higher values of \( \Omega_m \) lead to increased dark matter density in the Universe, which enhances the gravitational potential well of galaxies, thereby increasing their V_{max}.

Training models with M_{tot} or σ_{v} resulted in a significant degradation of model accuracy—100% and 43%, respectively—indicating that these properties are less informative. This is likely because V_{max} correlates more strongly with stellar mass than with subhalo mass, and it remains stable even when dark matter content is affected by tidal forces during halo accretion. Thus, V_{max} effectively probes the mass in the inner regions of the subhalo, which are less influenced by these processes.","V_{max} contains more information than M_t and \sigma_{\nu}, which are other properties that are expected to be heavily affected by dark matter.

2. **Challenges in Reproducing Galaxy Properties**: It will be difficult, if not impossible, to accurately reproduce the properties of real galaxies when using cosmological models with \( \Omega_m \) values that deviate significantly from the true value.

2. **Color Dispersion (σct)**: This term accounts for the small amount of dispersion added by blending, with a mean value of 0.07 mag.

Why is there such a large difference between the optical and NIR Wesenheit magnitude systematic errors in the HST paper?,"The large difference between the optical and NIR Wesenheit magnitude systematic errors in the HST paper can be attributed to several factors. The systematic error in the optical is 2.8%, which is significantly worse than the NIR counterpart and exceeds the statistical error. This discrepancy arises because variations in the treatment of reddening, metallicity, P–L relation breaks, and outlier rejection have a more pronounced effect on the optical Wesenheit magnitudes compared to the NIR ones. For instance, changes in the reddening law lead to larger shifts in H0 for the optical data than for the NIR data, with variations causing changes of up to 3.82 km s−1 Mpc−1 for optical versus much smaller changes for NIR. Additionally, adjustments to the P–L relation formulation also result in greater changes for the optical than for the NIR. This increased sensitivity in the optical is a natural consequence of the larger value of R, which further explains the systematic errors observed.","Changes to the treatment of reddening, metallicity, P–L relation breaks, and outlier rejection cause larger changes in H_0 for the optical than for the NIR Wesenheit magnitude calculations.",Same,0.982579353196398,CORRECT,y,1,1

This difference is considered to be at 99.9% confidence, suggesting that it is unlikely to be a fluke. Possible explanations for this tension include systematic errors in either the local H0 measurements or the CMB measurements, or an unexpected feature in the cosmological model.

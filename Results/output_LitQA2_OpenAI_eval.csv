These changes indicate global cellular disruptions, potentially due to partial misfolding of HsMOR-GFP and premature exit from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).

In contrast, on plastic, nearly 200% growth was noted, suggesting that the response to bleomycin is different based on the substrate. Furthermore, a near total growth arrest was achieved at 1/20th the required dose on plastic, implying that much lower doses of bleomycin are effective on softer matrices.

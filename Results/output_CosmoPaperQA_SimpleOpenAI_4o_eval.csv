"With the symbolic regression, how do the authors of CAMELS prevent overly complicated functions for predicting the cosmological quantities being passed down the generations?","In the CAMELS project, the authors use symbolic regression to derive analytic expressions that relate the star-formation rate density (SFRD) with various parameters. To prevent overly complicated functions from being passed down the generations, they assign a complexity value to each operator used in the symbolic regression. Simpler operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are given a lower complexity value (equal to 1), while more complex operations like logarithms and exponentials are assigned a higher complexity value (equal to 2).

What are the main limitations of the CAMELS simulations?,"The main limitations of the CAMELS simulations are as follows:

1. **Resolution Limitations**: The mass and spatial resolution in CAMELS do not allow for resolving scales below approximately 1h⁻¹kpc. This means that CAMELS cannot be used to place constraints on the nature of dark matter using probes that rely on the distribution of matter on very small scales, such as sub-halos in the Milky Way【4:0†2010.00619v2.pdf】.

2. **Volume Limitations**: The volume of the simulations is relatively small, at (25 h⁻¹Mpc)³. This limits the ability to account for long wavelength modes, which are important for the formation of large objects like galaxy clusters and for setting the proper normalization of the matter power spectrum on all scales【4:0†2010.00619v2.pdf】.

3. **Parameter Limitations**: CAMELS is limited to variations of only two cosmological parameters and four astrophysical parameters. This restricts the ability to separate effects that may depend on different cosmological parameters and limits the exploration of the parameter space【4:0†2010.00619v2.pdf】.

These limitations highlight the challenges in using CAMELS for certain types of cosmological analyses, particularly those requiring high resolution or large volume simulations, and those needing a broader exploration of parameter space.",The mass and spatial resolution in CAMELS does not allow for resolution of scales below \approx 1 h^{−1}kpc.

What are the reasons for the systematic differences between the IllustrisTNG and the SIMBA suites in CAMELS?,"The systematic differences between the IllustrisTNG and SIMBA suites in the CAMELS project arise primarily from the distinct subgrid models and feedback implementations used in each simulation suite. These differences lead to variations in galaxy properties and their distribution in parameter space. For instance, SIMBA galaxies tend to be larger on average than those in IllustrisTNG, except for galaxies with low stellar masses【4:0†2010.00619v2.pdf】. Additionally, the two suites exhibit different responses to changes in cosmological and astrophysical parameters, particularly in the matter power spectrum and star formation rate density【4:2†2010.00619v2.pdf】.

The subgrid models in IllustrisTNG and SIMBA are fundamentally different, which affects how galaxies populate the parameter space and respond to variations in parameters like Ωm and σ8【4:1†2201.02202v1.pdf】.

This inference is based on data from state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations from the CAMELS project, which include a wide range of cosmological and astrophysical models【4:0†2201.02202v1.pdf】.

However, the models are not robust to changes in subgrid physics, which means that the results may not be directly applicable to real galaxies without considering these limitations.

How does CAMELS quantify the difference between cosmological/astrophysical parameter variations and the random variations in the initial conditions in the measured quantities?,"CAMELS quantifies the difference between cosmological/astrophysical parameter variations and random variations in the initial conditions by using different sets of simulations. Specifically, the project uses the LH (Latin Hypercube) set to vary both the initial random field and the cosmological and astrophysical parameters simultaneously. This allows for the computation of the median and range of variation of various properties, such as the matter power spectrum and star formation rate density【4:4†2010.00619v2.pdf】.

To isolate the effects of cosmic variance, CAMELS employs the CV (Cosmic Variance) set, where the cosmological and astrophysical parameters are held constant, and only the initial random seed is varied. This helps in quantifying what fraction of the range of variation is due to cosmic variance versus changes in cosmology and astrophysics【4:9†2010.00619v2.pdf】.

Furthermore, the 1P (One Parameter) set is used to study the response of observables to changes in a single parameter while keeping the initial conditions constant, thus minimizing the effects of cosmic variance【4:4†2010.00619v2.pdf】.

"In the ""Cosmology with one galaxy?"" paper, why does the neural network use V_{max} much more than other properties that are heavily affected by dark matter?","The neural network in the ""Cosmology with one galaxy?"" paper uses $V_{max}$ more than other properties because $V_{max}$ contains more information about the dark matter content of galaxies than other properties like the subhalo total mass ($M_{tot}$) or velocity dispersion ($\sigma_v$). This is because $V_{max}$ correlates more strongly with stellar mass than with subhalo mass. When halos are accreted into larger halos, they may lose a significant fraction of their dark matter content due to tidal forces, which affects the dark matter content of galaxies significantly. However, the value of $V_{max}$ remains relatively stable as it mostly probes the mass in the inner regions of the subhalo, which are less affected by these processes【4:0†2201.02202v1.pdf】.

1. **SIMBA Model**: The wind velocity parameterization in SIMBA is based on the FIRE simulations and scales with the galaxy's circular velocity, \( v_{\text{circ}} \), following a specific formula. This model includes a parameter, ASN2, which controls the normalization of the wind velocity. The wind velocity is further adjusted by the potential difference between the launch point and a specific radius (0.25 times the virial radius). SIMBA also limits the wind kinetic energy to the available supernova energy, attenuating the wind velocity when necessary【4:0†2010.00619v2.pdf】.

2. **IllustrisTNG Model**: In contrast, the IllustrisTNG model implements galactic winds driven by stellar feedback using a kinetic approach where particles are ejected stochastically and isotropically. The wind speed, \( v_w \), and energy injection rate depend on local gas conditions such as metallicity and dark matter velocity dispersion, as well as redshift. The model uses global normalization parameters, ASN1 and ASN2, to modulate these effects.

What differences exist in the cosmological parameters between the low and high multipole likelihoods in the Planck 2018 paper?,"The Planck 2018 paper discusses differences in cosmological parameters between low and high multipole likelihoods. The main differences arise from the large-scale temperature dip observed in the low multipole range (20 ≤ ` ≤ 30), which affects the parameter constraints. This dip tends to pull the low-multipole results away from the high-multipole results, leading to some tension between the two. Specifically, the high multipole results (` ≥ 802) tend to pull parameters towards a region of higher matter density and fluctuation amplitude, and lower values of the spectral index (ns) and Hubble constant (H0) compared to the low multipole range【4:0†source】.

The differences in parameters such as Ωmh2 are evident, with a discrepancy at the 2.8σ level for temperature likelihoods. When polarization data is included, the results from different multipole ranges become more consistent, although the difference in Ωmh2 remains unusual at about the 2σ level【4:2†source】.

Why are BAO measurements utilised with such significance in Planck papers?,"Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements are utilized with significant importance in Planck papers because they provide a robust geometrical test of cosmology.

This insensitivity allows BAO measurements to serve as a reliable tool for testing cosmological models without the complications introduced by nonlinear effects【4:0†1807.06209v4.pdf】.

The oscillations are imprinted on the CMB as peaks and troughs in the power spectrum, corresponding to the density fluctuations at the time of recombination.

What are the contributions to the overall statistical error of the Cephid-based distance measurements for the HST?,"The contributions to the overall statistical error of the Cepheid-based distance measurements for the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) include several components:

For SN Ia hosts at 20–40 Mpc and for NGC4258, the mean σsky is 0.28 mag, though it can vary depending on local stellar density【4:0†1604.01424v3.pdf】.

2. **Color Term Uncertainty (σct):** This uncertainty arises from the dispersion added by blending, which affects the optical colors. The mean value for σct is 0.07 mag across all hosts【4:0†1604.01424v3.pdf】.

3. **Intrinsic Dispersion (σint):** This results from the nonzero temperature width of the Cepheid instability strip. It is empirically determined using nearby Cepheid samples, with a value of σint = 0.08 mag for mW_H【4:0†1604.01424v3.pdf】.

4. **Random-Phase Error (σph):** This error is due to the use of random- or limited-phase magnitudes rather than mean-phase magnitudes. Monte Carlo sampling shows that using a single random phase adds an error of σph = 0.12 mag【4:0†1604.01424v3.pdf】.

What are the sources of the differences between the \lambdaCDM parameters between Planck 2015 and 2018?,"The differences in the ΛCDM parameters between the Planck 2015 and 2018 releases are primarily due to several key factors:

1. **New Polarization Low-` Likelihood**: The largest cause of shifts between the 2015 and 2018 parameters is the use of the new HFI low-` polarization likelihood instead of the 2015 LFI likelihood. This change led to a lowering and tightening of the constraint on the optical depth to reionization (τ), which in turn affected other parameters such as the amplitude of the primordial power spectrum (ln(1010As)), the cold dark matter density (ωc), and the scalar spectral index (ns)【4:0†source】.

2. **Polarization Corrections in the High-` Likelihood**: Corrections applied to the polarization spectra, particularly the beam-leakage correction in the TE high-` likelihood, caused shifts in parameters such as the baryon density (ωb) and the scalar spectral index (ns). These corrections were significant in adjusting the parameters to account for systematic effects【4:0†source】.

3. **Correction of Systematic Effects**: The 2018 analysis included corrections for systematic effects in the polarization spectra, such as temperature-to-polarization leakage and polarization efficiencies, which were not adequately characterized in the 2015 analysis.

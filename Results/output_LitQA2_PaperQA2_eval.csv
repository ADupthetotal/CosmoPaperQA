Acinetobacter lwoffii has been evolved in the lab to be resistant to which of these antibiotics?,"Acinetobacter lwoffii has been evolved in laboratory conditions to be resistant only to ciprofloxacin. This finding is supported by multiple studies indicating that A. lwoffii demonstrated clinical resistance solely to this antibiotic during mutant evolution experiments (darby2023differentialdevelopmentof pages 10-11). In contrast, Acinetobacter baumannii, a closely related species, evolved resistance to multiple antibiotics, including meropenem, ciprofloxacin, and gentamicin (darby2023differentialdevelopmentof pages 7-8).

The limited capacity of A. lwoffii to develop resistance is attributed to its genetic makeup, which includes encoding only one tripartite resistance-nodulation-division (RND) efflux system, AdeIJK. This may restrict the selection of drug-resistance mutations (darby2023differentialdevelopmentof pages 15-16). Additionally, A. lwoffii has more stringent DNA repair mechanisms, which could further limit resistance development (darby2023differentialdevelopmentof pages 15-16). Overall, the evolutionary response of A. lwoffii to ciprofloxacin contrasts sharply with the broader resistance profile observed in A. baumannii, highlighting significant differences in antibiotic resistance development between these two species (darby2023differentialdevelopmentof pages 1-1).",ciproflaxin,Same,0.7,INCORRECT,y,0,1
Beta-amyrin synthase from which of the following plants produces in the highest yield of beta-amyrin from squalene?,"Beta-amyrin synthase (BAS) from *Saponaria vaccaria* (SvBAS) produces the highest yield of beta-amyrin from squalene, achieving a production level of 899.0 mg/L over a three-day period. This result was obtained through the integration of SvBAS into the engineered yeast strain JWY601, which had an upregulated mevalonate pathway, specifically enhancing the expression of genes encoding ERG20 and ERG1 (liu2024completebiosynthesisof pages 2-2, 10-12). 

The study evaluated BASs from various plants, including *Artemisia annua*, *Arabidopsis thaliana*, and *Glycyrrhiza glabra*, but none surpassed the yield achieved with SvBAS (liu2024completebiosynthesisof pages 2-2). The production was statistically validated, indicating the robustness of the findings (liu2024completebiosynthesisof pages 10-12). 

Overall, the integration of SvBAS into a genetically engineered yeast system represents a significant advancement in the biosynthesis of triterpenoids, particularly beta-amyrin, from squalene, highlighting the potential for biotechnological applications in producing valuable compounds (liu2024completebiosynthesisof pages 1-2, 9-9).",Saponaria vaccaria,Same,1,CORRECT,y,1,1
"Are enhancer and promoter sequences broadly compatible in human cells, and is this the same as in drosophila?","Enhancer and promoter sequences are broadly compatible in human cells, as demonstrated by the study utilizing the ExP STARR-seq assay. This research indicates that most human enhancers activate all promoters similarly, with their activities combining multiplicatively to determine RNA output (bergman2022compatibilityrulesof pages 1-1). The study also identifies that while enhancer-promoter interactions are generally compatible, subtle preferences exist. Specifically, housekeeping gene promoters are less responsive to distal enhancers, whereas variably expressed gene promoters show greater responsiveness (bergman2022compatibilityrulesof pages 8-9).

In contrast, the compatibility of enhancer and promoter sequences in Drosophila is characterized by greater specificity. Previous studies have shown that developmental and housekeeping gene promoters in Drosophila exhibit strong preferences for distinct enhancer sequences and cofactors (bergman2022compatibilityrulesof pages 8-9). This suggests that while the mechanisms of enhancer-promoter interactions may be conserved across species, the specific compatibility rules differ qualitatively between humans and Drosophila (bergman2022compatibilityrulesof pages 9-10). Thus, the broad compatibility observed in human cells is not mirrored in Drosophila, where interactions are more selective.","yes, no",Different,0.812933245333021,INCORRECT,y,0,1
Approximately what percentage of Drosophila with a H3.3K36R mutation finish developing and enclose?,"The percentage of Drosophila with an H3.3K36R mutation that complete development and eclose is reported to be approximately 80%, which is nearly identical to the eclosion frequency of control animals (H3.3Ctrl) (salzler2024set2andh3k36 pages 7-9). However, other excerpts indicate a significant reduction in developmental success for H3.3K36R mutants compared to wild-type controls, although specific percentages are not provided (salzler2024set2andh3k36 pages 49-50). 

Additionally, the context suggests that while H3.3K36R mutants may progress to the larval stage, adult eclosion is not achieved in certain other mutant lines, indicating variability in developmental outcomes (salzler2024set2andh3k36 pages 5-7). The methodology for assessing viability included statistical analysis of pupal and adult counts, but explicit results for the H3.3K36R mutation alone are not detailed (salzler2024set2andh3k36 pages 33-35).

Active olfactory receptor genes increase their contacts with greek island regions by what factor in mouse olfactory neurons?,"Active olfactory receptor (OR) genes in mouse olfactory neurons exhibit significantly increased contacts with Greek Island (GI) regions compared to inactive OR genes. Specifically, data from HiChIP experiments indicate that active ORs have an average of 2.76 ± 3.91 contacts per billion (cpb), while inactive ORs show only 1.03 ± 1.74 cpb. This represents an increase by a factor of approximately 2.7 (pourmorady2023rnamediatedsymmetrybreaking pages 19-23).

Further analysis of various genetic constructs reveals that the gg8-tTA>tetO-P2 construct shows the highest contact frequency with GIs at 684 cpb, followed by P2-IRES-GFP at 547 cpb, OMP-tTA>tetO-P2 at 503 cpb, and OMP-tTA>tetO-P2(nc) at 421 cpb (pourmorady2023rnamediatedsymmetrybreaking pages 23-27). These findings underscore the role of active OR genes in enhancing interactions with GI regions, which are critical for the transcriptional regulation and singular choice of olfactory receptors during the development of olfactory sensory neurons (pourmorady2023rnamediatedsymmetrybreaking pages 6-6).

Does metabolic glycan labeling immobilize dendritic cell membrane and enhance antitumor efficacy of dendritic cell vaccine?,"Metabolic glycan labeling has been shown to immobilize dendritic cell (DC) membranes and enhance the antitumor efficacy of DC vaccines. This technique utilizes azido-sugars, specifically tetraacetyl-N-azidoacetylmannosamine (Ac4ManNAz), to introduce azido groups onto the DC membranes. The incorporation of these groups reduces the mobility of membrane proteins, such as ICAM-1, and upregulates activation markers including CD86, MHCII, CD40, and CCR7, thereby enhancing the activation status of DCs (han2023metabolicglycanlabeling pages 1-2, 4-4).

The immobilization of DC membranes improves their ability to process and present antigens, leading to enhanced antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses (han2023metabolicglycanlabeling pages 1-1, 2-4). Furthermore, the azido groups facilitate bioorthogonal conjugation of cytokines, such as IL-15, which further boosts cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses and therapeutic outcomes (han2023metabolicglycanlabeling pages 1-1, 12-13). Overall, these findings suggest that metabolic glycan labeling is a promising strategy for developing more effective DC-based cancer immunotherapies (han2023metabolicglycanlabeling pages 2-4).",Yes,Same,0.855186477892534,CORRECT,y,1,1
Approximately how many unique transposable element insertion loci are there in the mandarin (Citrus reticulata) genome?,"The exact number of unique transposable element insertion loci (ILs) in the mandarin (Citrus reticulata) genome is not explicitly provided in the available literature. A study identified 12,309 mandarin-specific transposable element insertion loci through the analysis of 34 transposable element (TE) families across various accessions, including sweet orange (Citrus × sinensis) and pummelo (Citrus maxima) (wu2024transposonactivitiesdrive pages 8-10). However, this figure pertains specifically to insertion loci that are distinct to the mandarin genome.

Further analysis of RNA-seq datasets from 39 mandarin transcriptomes aimed to detect CiMULE2 insertion loci by scanning for uniquely mapped read pairs overlapping specific regions, but it did not specify the total number of unique ILs in the mandarin genome (wu2024transposonactivitiesdrive pages 28-29). Additionally, while the study discusses the diversity of transposon insertions across mandarin, sweet orange, and pummelo genomes, it does not provide a direct count of unique ILs in the mandarin genome (wu2024transposonactivitiesdrive pages 10-13; wu2024transposonactivitiesdrive pages 20-21; wu2024transposonactivitiesdrive pages 15-17).

"Based on the single-cell transcriptome analysis highlighting fatty acid metabolism-mediated metastasis and immunosuppression in male breast cancer, what percentage of ER+ MBC patients showed AR-negative status when evaluated by IHR?","The single-cell transcriptome analysis of male breast cancer (MBC) does not provide specific information regarding the percentage of estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) MBC patients who showed androgen receptor (AR)-negative status when evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC). However, it is noted that in a large cohort study, the percentage of AR-negative patients was significantly lower in MBC compared to female breast cancer (FBC) samples. Specifically, only 5.3% of ER+ MBC patients were found to be AR-negative, in contrast to 17.4% of ER+ FBC patients (sun2023singlecelltranscriptomeanalysis pages 4-5). 

The study emphasizes the differences in immune cell infiltration and the role of fatty acid metabolism in metastasis and immunosuppression in MBC, but it does not elaborate further on AR status percentages in ER+ MBC patients beyond the aforementioned data (sun2023singlecelltranscriptomeanalysis pages 1-2, 11-12, 12-12).

"Based on experiments done in cohorts of mice injected with B16-F10 melanoma cells expressing ovalbumin, at what time of day is the number of tumor-infiltrating leukocytes the highest?","In experiments conducted with cohorts of mice injected with B16-F10 melanoma cells expressing ovalbumin, the number of tumor-infiltrating leukocytes (TILs) exhibited significant circadian oscillations. The overall number of TILs was found to peak in the evening, specifically at Zeitgeber Time 13 (ZT13), which is 13 hours after light onset in a 12-hour light/12-hour dark environment. This peak was confirmed through immunofluorescence staining, demonstrating higher T cell counts in the evening compared to the morning (ZT1) (wang2024circadiantumorinfiltration pages 3-3).

Further investigations revealed that the infiltration of leukocytes, including CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, was consistently higher at ZT13 than at ZT1 across multiple experiments and under varying light conditions (wang2024circadiantumorinfiltration pages 4-5). The study also indicated that this time-of-day-dependent infiltration was regulated by the circadian clock machinery of endothelial cells, as evidenced by the lack of time-of-day differences in leukocyte infiltration in Bmal1DEC mice (wang2024circadiantumorinfiltration pages 5-6).

"Based on single-nuclei RNA sequencing data, myotendinous junction myonuclei are enriched for genes involved in which of the following functions?","Myotendinous junction (MTJ) myonuclei are enriched for genes involved in several critical functions, as revealed by single-nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) data. These myonuclei exhibit a significant expression of genes associated with cell–matrix interactions, such as COL22A1 and ADGRB4, which are essential for maintaining the structural and functional integrity of the MTJ in skeletal muscle (lai2024multimodalcellatlas pages 3-3). 

Additionally, MTJ myonuclei show high levels of neuromuscular junction (NMJ)-related genes, including CHRNA1, CHRNG, MUSK, and COLQ, which are linked to cell adhesion and compensatory responses to innervation loss (lai2024multimodalcellatlas pages 2-3). They are also enriched for stress and pro-inflammatory genes (e.g., FOS, JUN, EGR1) and proteolysis-related genes (e.g., FBXO32, CTSD), indicating their roles in stress response, inflammation, and muscle remodeling processes (lai2024multimodalcellatlas pages 2-3).

Furthermore, MTJ myonuclei are associated with processes such as striated muscle contraction and signaling pathways, including TNF signaling through NF-κB and NOTCH2 signaling, highlighting their involvement in muscle function (lai2024multimodalcellatlas pages 4-4).

Does targeting sgRNAs to coding strands or template strands in gene bodies lead to higher effect size on average across multiple CRISPRi screens?,"Targeting single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) to coding strands in gene bodies results in significantly higher effect sizes compared to targeting template strands across multiple CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) screens. This coding strand bias has been consistently observed, with studies indicating that the average effect sizes of sgRNAs targeting coding strands are more than twofold higher than those targeting template strands (yao2024multicenterintegratedanalysis pages 8-9). The phenomenon appears to be influenced by the KRAB repressor and may involve competition with RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II)-mediated transcription on the template strand (yao2024multicenterintegratedanalysis pages 9-10).

The analysis further highlights that this strand specificity is particularly pronounced in non-cis-regulatory element (non-CRE) regions of gene bodies, where coding strand-targeting sgRNAs demonstrate superior efficiency (yao2024multicenterintegratedanalysis pages 9-10). Statistical comparisons across multiple replicates and loci confirm that the median effect of coding strand-targeting sgRNAs exceeds that of template strand-targeting sgRNAs (yao2024multicenterintegratedanalysis pages 28-31).

How diffuse are the laminar patterns of the axonal terminations of lower Layer 5/Layer 6 intratelencephalic neurons compared to Layer 2-4 intratelencephalic neurons in mouse cortex?,"The laminar patterns of axonal terminations of lower Layer 5/Layer 6 intratelencephalic (IT) neurons in the mouse cortex are characterized by a more diffuse projection pattern compared to those of Layer 2-4 IT neurons. Specifically, deep-layer neurons (lower Layer 5/Layer 6) exhibit axonal projections that are less focal, terminating predominantly in deeper layers of the target areas. In contrast, upper-layer (Layer 2/3) and middle-layer (Layer 4 to upper Layer 5) neurons demonstrate more localized axonal terminations, with upper-layer neurons focusing their projections in smaller, more specific areas (yuan2023massivemultiplexingof pages 14-15; yuan2023massivemultiplexingof pages 33-36).

The study highlights that while deep-layer neurons preferentially terminate in deep layers, upper and middle-layer neurons often project to more superficial contralateral targets, indicating a clear distinction in the termination patterns based on the soma layer position. This variability in projection patterns underscores the complexity of corticocortical connectivity in the mouse cortex (yuan2023massivemultiplexingof pages 11-12; yuan2023massivemultiplexingof pages 12-14).",More diffuse,Same,0.89014123774075,CORRECT,y,1,1
Expression of human mu-opioid receptor (HsMOR) with an N-terminal yeast αPrePro sequence has what effect on yeast cell phenotype?,"The expression of the human mu-opioid receptor (HsMOR) with an N-terminal yeast αPrePro sequence in yeast cells leads to significant alterations in cell phenotype. Notable changes include the enlargement of granular cells, expansion of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes, and the relocalization of HsMOR-GFP to punctate structures within the cells. These alterations suggest that the αPrePro sequence induces global cellular disruptions, likely due to partial misfolding of HsMOR-GFP (bean2022functionalexpressionof pages 5-6).

While the incorporation of the αPrePro sequence subtly improved HsMOR sensitivity, it also resulted in reduced signaling populations, indicating that the overall benefits of this sequence are limited (bean2022functionalexpressionof pages 5-6). Additionally, the αPrePro sequence was associated with premature ER exit and cellular stress, which interfered with signaling competency, although it did not consistently disrupt cellular morphology (bean2022functionalexpressionof pages 5-5). Thus, the expression of HsMOR with the αPrePro sequence presents a complex relationship between receptor expression, cellular stress, and yeast cell phenotype (bean2022functionalexpressionof pages 5-5).",Enlarged granular cells,Similar,0.924765742351907,CORRECT,y,1,1
"For the channelrhodopsin found in Hyphochytrium catenoides (HcKCR1), the homology based structure predicted by ColabFold has a poor prediction for which one of the following transmembrane helices out of the 7 seven transmembrane helices in the structure ?","The homology model for HcKCR1, a channelrhodopsin from Hyphochytrium catenoides, does not explicitly identify which of the seven transmembrane helices (TM1-TM7) has a poor prediction based on ColabFold. The available context indicates that while the overall prediction accuracy is reasonable, with a root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of 0.60 Å for Cα atoms between the ColabFold model and the experimentally determined structure, no specific helix is singled out as having a poor prediction (morizumi2023structuresofchannelrhodopsin pages 3-4). 

Additionally, the structural analysis highlights that the homology models were particularly strong for helices TM1, TM6, and TM7, while the extracellular TM2-TM3 loop region was weakly predicted (morizumi2023structuresofchannelrhodopsin pages 4-5). However, the excerpts do not provide a definitive answer regarding which specific transmembrane helix suffers from poor prediction.

Grafting ECL3 region from adenosine A3 receptor A3AR onto A2AAR does what to the efficacy of binding to the A3AR antagonist CF101 ?,"Grafting the extracellular loop 3 (ECL3) region from the A3 adenosine receptor (A3AR) onto the A2A adenosine receptor (A2AAR) enhances the binding efficacy of the A3AR-selective antagonist CF101. The study indicates that the ECL3 region plays a critical role in mediating selective recognition and binding of CF101 to A3AR. By engineering chimeric receptors that incorporate the ECL3 from A3AR into A2AAR, researchers observed that these chimeric receptors exhibited increased potency or efficacy in binding CF101 (cai2024cryoemstructuresof pages 4-5).

Furthermore, mutations in the ECL3 region that mimic the length and sequence of A2AAR resulted in a complete loss of binding ability to CF101, underscoring the importance of the specific amino acid sequence and structural features of ECL3 for selective binding (cai2024cryoemstructuresof pages 5-6). The proximity of ECL3 to the N6 position in adenosine is also highlighted as a key factor influencing ligand selectivity (cai2024cryoemstructuresof pages 5-6). Overall, these findings suggest that the unique characteristics of ECL3 are essential for the selective binding of CF101 to A3AR, and grafting this region onto A2AAR could potentially enhance its interaction with CF101 (cai2024cryoemstructuresof pages 6-6).",increases,Same,0.7,INCORRECT,y,0,1
Formation of a mycobacterial repressor DarR dimer results in how much of the surface being buried from the solvent?,"The formation of a mycobacterial repressor DarR dimer results in the burial of approximately 1300 Å² of surface area from the solvent. This structural detail was elucidated through crystallographic analysis of DarR from Mycobacterium smegmatis and Mycobacterium baixiangningiae, which highlighted the dimer assembly and its implications for surface interactions (schumacher2023structuresofthe pages 2-3). 

The dimerization of DarR is facilitated by the interaction of helices α8 and α9 with their counterparts, forming a four-helix bundle dimerization module. This structural arrangement is critical for the protein's ability to bind to palindromic DNA sequences, a characteristic feature of TetR family proteins (schumacher2023structuresofthe pages 1-2). 

Additionally, the DarR-DNA complex reveals a dimer-of-dimers binding mode, where significant protein-protein interactions occur, allowing the dimer to effectively engage with DNA and function as a repressing roadblock (schumacher2023structuresofthe pages 6-7). The structural stability of this complex is further supported by critical inter-subunit contacts formed between residues 116-125 of each subunit (schumacher2023structuresofthe pages 6-7).",1300 anstrom^2,Same,0.874663299673005,CORRECT,y,1,1
Has anyone assessed doing tagmentation of cDNA directly in the PCR mix without cleaning and quantifying the cDNA first?,"The assessment of performing tagmentation of cDNA directly in the PCR mix without prior cleaning and quantification has not been explicitly documented in the available literature. The study by Hagemann-Jensen et al. (2021) explored tagmentation of cDNA products after preamplification, indicating that while they demonstrated the feasibility of tagmentation on cDNA without cleaning and quantification, this was specifically in the context of using fewer PCR cycles (Smart-seq3xpress) (hagemannjensen2021scalablefulltranscriptcoverage pages 3-4). 

However, subsequent sections of the study do not provide direct evidence of tagmentation being performed in the PCR mix without prior purification.

Overall, while the study indicates a novel approach to streamline the process, it does not explicitly assess the direct tagmentation of cDNA in the PCR mix without prior cleaning and quantification (hagemannjensen2021scalablefulltranscriptcoverage pages 10-12; hagemannjensen2021scalablefulltranscriptcoverage pages 23-23).",Yes,Same,0.860301398686394,CORRECT,n,0,0
How do microstimulations in the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex of monkeys in a prior experiment affect decision-making in later decision-making experiments?,"Microstimulations in the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) of monkeys have been shown to significantly influence decision-making in subsequent experiments. Specifically, these microstimulations induce a negative bias in decision-making, particularly during approach-avoidance tasks. In these tasks, monkeys faced choices between receiving rewards and penalties, and sgACC stimulation led to a notable increase in avoidance decisions (Av) and a decrease in approach decisions (Ap) (amemori2024cingulatemicrostimulationinduces pages 1-2, 13-13).

The underlying mechanism involves a reduction in top-down processing within the fronto-cingulo-striatal (FCS) network. This was evidenced by diminished directional influence from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) to limbic regions, as measured by changes in the directional asymmetry index (DAI) and Granger causality in local field potentials (amemori2024cingulatemicrostimulationinduces pages 1-1, 11-12). The effective sgACC microstimulation disrupted interareal synchronization, particularly in the alpha and beta frequency bands, which is hypothesized to contribute to the observed negative decision-making bias (amemori2024cingulatemicrostimulationinduces pages 7-8).

How do the human SNVs French 2 and Indian 2 affect the affinity of the transcription factor ETS-1 to DNA?,"The human single nucleotide variants (SNVs) French 2 (334 T>G) and Indian 2 (328 C>G) are located in the ETS-A site of the ZRS enhancer and have been shown to subtly increase the binding affinity of the transcription factor ETS-1 to DNA. Specifically, the relative affinity of the ETS-A site increases from 0.15 in the wild-type (WT) sequence to 0.24 for French 2 and to 0.26 for Indian 2, as measured by protein binding microarray (PBM) data (lim2024affinityoptimizingenhancervariants pages 1-2, 2-2). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) further confirm that both variants bind ETS-1 more strongly than the WT sequence (lim2024affinityoptimizingenhancervariants pages 2-2).

Despite the increased binding affinity, the study indicates that these SNVs do not significantly enhance gene expression in a cell-line massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA), suggesting limitations in capturing subtle changes in expression (lim2024affinityoptimizingenhancervariants pages 4-5). Additionally, the Indian 2 SNV was misclassified in another reporter assay, highlighting the challenges in assessing the functional impact of these variants (lim2024affinityoptimizingenhancervariants pages 4-5).

How does knocking out DNA methyltransferase in neurons affect repeat-derived RNA expression?,"Knocking out DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) in neurons leads to a significant increase in the expression of repeat-derived RNA, particularly from intracisternal A-type particle (IAP) elements. In DNMT triple knockout (DNMT-TKO) neurons, there is a dramatic 200-fold induction of IAP-derived RNA, which constitutes one-third of the total repeat-derived RNA expressed (kaluscha2022evidencethatdirect pages 6-6). This upregulation is associated with increased chromatin accessibility and enhanced binding of RNA polymerase II (POL2) at IAP long terminal repeats (LTRs), indicating that DNA methylation plays a critical role in repressing repeat-derived RNA expression in neurons (kaluscha2022evidencethatdirect pages 7-8).

The absence of DNA methylation also results in the de-repression of other repeat elements, such as IAPLTR1/1a, which are normally kept in check by methylation (kaluscha2022evidencethatdirect pages 8-8). The loss of methylation-sensitive transcription factor (TF) binding inhibition, particularly involving factors like CREB1, is a key mechanism behind this derepression (kaluscha2022evidencethatdirect pages 8-9). Consequently, the activation of repeat-derived RNA can lead to cellular dysfunction, potentially inducing cell death through various mechanisms (kaluscha2022evidencethatdirect pages 8-9).",strong increase,Same,0.965701750192656,CORRECT,y,1,1

How long do mouse neurons survive following CRISPR inactivation of HSPA5?,"Mouse neurons exhibit a significant decline in survival following CRISPR inactivation of the HSPA5 gene. Specifically, studies indicate that the inactivation of Hspa5 in mouse neurons leads to marked neuronal death within a 2-week timeframe. In experiments involving primary neurons cultured from LSL-CRISPRi mice, the delivery of sgHspa5 via adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) resulted in substantial Cre-dependent neuronal death within 2 weeks of expression (ramani2023crisprscreeningby pages 9-10). 

Further investigations demonstrated that neuronal survival was assessed by counting GFP+ nuclei, with a peak fluorescence observed at day 8 post-transduction. Subsequent imaging and survival quantification revealed a decline in neuronal survival, confirming that the inactivation of HSPA5 is detrimental to neuronal viability (ramani2023crisprscreeningby pages 35-39).

How many clades of adenosine deaminases are there when grouped according to structure-based clustering?,"The number of clades of adenosine deaminases identified through structure-based clustering is not explicitly stated in the available context. The study by Huang et al. utilized a structure-based clustering approach, employing AlphaFold2-predicted structures to classify deaminase proteins, including adenosine deaminases, into clades based on structural similarities (huang2023discoveryofnew pages 5-6). 

While the research identified a total of 16 deaminase families (clades) and one outgroup (JAB) based on structural similarities, it does not specify how many of these clades pertain specifically to adenosine deaminases (huang2023discoveryofnew pages 18-21). Additionally, the text mentions various clades and sub-clades of deaminases but does not provide a clear count for adenosine deaminases (huang2023discoveryofnew pages 37-38).

How does pexmetinib change the rate of threonine dephosphorylation by WIP1 phosphatase?,"Pexmetinib enhances the rate of threonine dephosphorylation at the pT180 residue by WIP1 phosphatase through a mechanism involving conformational changes in the p38α MAP kinase activation loop. Specifically, pexmetinib induces a conformational shift that flips the activation loop, thereby exposing the phospho-threonine (pT180) to solvent and making it accessible for dephosphorylation by WIP1 (stadnicki2024dualactionkinaseinhibitors pages 5-7). This conformational stabilization is achieved through interactions with the conserved DFG motif, particularly hydrogen bonding with D168 and hydrophobic interactions with F169, leading to a tenfold increase in the dephosphorylation rate (stadnicki2024dualactionkinaseinhibitors pages 5-7).

Additionally, the presence of tyrosine phosphorylation at pY182 further enhances this effect by providing additional stabilizing contacts, although pexmetinib can still induce the activation loop flip in the absence of tyrosine phosphorylation, albeit with increased conformational flexibility (stadnicki2024dualactionkinaseinhibitors pages 8-10). Overall, pexmetinib shifts the equilibrium of the activation loop towards a dephosphorylation-competent state, facilitating the action of WIP1 phosphatase and increasing the efficiency of threonine dephosphorylation (stadnicki2024dualactionkinaseinhibitors pages 10-12).",Increases dephosphorylation,Same,0.940027488236635,CORRECT,y,1,1
How many FMD cycles are the minimum required to cause a significant delay in the growth of melanoma tumors in mice?,"The minimum number of fasting mimicking diet (FMD) cycles required to cause a significant delay in the growth of melanoma tumors in mice is two. This conclusion is supported by findings that indicate two cycles of FMD, when combined with anti-OX40 and anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy, resulted in a significant delay in the progression of B16F10 melanoma tumors. In contrast, anti-OX40/anti-PD-L1 therapy alone did not affect melanoma growth, highlighting the necessity of FMD cycles for achieving a notable impact (cortellino2023fastingmimickingdiet pages 2-3).

Additionally, the study suggests that even two FMD cycles did not yield significant effects in a lung cancer model, implying that multiple cycles may be necessary for stronger anti-cancer effects across different cancer types (cortellino2023fastingmimickingdiet pages 10-12). While one cycle of FMD was insufficient to significantly delay tumor growth, the combination of two cycles with immunotherapy demonstrated a strong tumor growth delay, reinforcing the requirement for at least two cycles to observe significant therapeutic benefits (cortellino2023fastingmimickingdiet pages 1-2).",2,Same,0.920232422928441,CORRECT,y,1,1

This analysis identified a total of 38,451 phosphopeptides, indicating a comprehensive assessment of phosphorylation events in response to forskolin treatment (niemann2022apoptoticbrownadipocytes pages 2-3). 

Additionally, the study notes that 2,535 phosphorylation sites were significantly regulated in both forskolin and inosine treatments, highlighting the overlapping effects of these compounds on phosphorylation dynamics in brown adipocytes (niemann2022apoptoticbrownadipocytes pages 2-3). However, other excerpts from the study do not provide further specific numbers regarding the phosphorylation sites regulated by forskolin alone, indicating that the primary source of this information is the high-sensitivity phosphoproteomic analysis mentioned (niemann2022apoptoticbrownadipocytes pages 11-12; niemann2022apoptoticbrownadipocytes pages 12-13).

"How much more sensitive to desiccation is a katE mutant strain of Acinetobacter baumanii, relative to wild-type?","The katE mutant strain of *Acinetobacter baumannii* exhibits significantly increased sensitivity to desiccation compared to the wild-type strain. Specifically, the loss of viability of the katE mutant strain at day 6 of desiccation at 2% relative humidity (RH) is reported to be 7.5 times greater than that of the wild-type strain (Oda2022 pages 5-6). Additionally, another assessment indicates that the katE mutant strain is approximately 5-fold more sensitive to desiccation than the wild-type strain, as determined through desiccation assays using opaque colonies of *Acinetobacter baumannii* AB5075 and its mutant derivatives (Oda2022 pages 6-6). 

The katE gene encodes catalase, which plays a crucial role in desiccation tolerance by mitigating oxidative stress caused by reactive oxygen species during desiccation (Oda2022 pages 7-8).

How much of the LIMK PDZ domain is identical in human LIMK1 and human LIMK2 ?,"The LIMK PDZ (PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1) domains of human LIMK1 and LIMK2 exhibit a high degree of sequence conservation, with 47% identity and 81% similarity. This significant conservation is observed across various species, indicating a robust structural and functional similarity between the two isoforms (casanovasepulveda2023autoregulationofthe pages 3-3). 

While specific sequence alignments reveal conserved residues and structural elements, the exact percentage of identity is not consistently stated across the sources. For instance, the alignment highlights unique features such as the replacement of a hydrophobic residue with a conserved arginine in the x-Φ-G-Φ motif, which is maintained in both LIMK1 and LIMK2 (casanovasepulveda2023autoregulationofthe pages 2-3). Additionally, specific conserved residues, such as E206 in LIMK2 corresponding to E225 in LIMK1, further underscore the similarity between the two PDZ domains (casanovasepulveda2023autoregulationofthe pages 6-7).

This prediction is based on analyses conducted using a randomized sequence library, which identified specific amino acid residues and their positions that contribute to proteasomal degradation (truex2023designofcytotoxic pages 6-8). 

The study utilized machine learning to develop a model that predicts degradation propensity based on the sequence features of C-terminal residues. The model was trained on a dataset of 22,564 sequences, allowing for the quantification of degradation propensity through the CDI, which ranges from 0 to 100 (truex2023designofcytotoxic pages 4-6). Lower CDI values indicate a higher likelihood of degradation, and the presence of Serine at the specified positions is associated with such outcomes (truex2023designofcytotoxic pages 30-33). 

Overall, the findings underscore the significance of specific amino acid placements in influencing proteasomal stability and degradation, which are critical factors in the design of cytotoxic T cell epitopes (truex2023designofcytotoxic pages 12-14).",-3,Same,1,CORRECT,y,1,1
"In 5XFAD mice, what effect does microglia-specific Ifnar1 deletion have on post-synaptic terminals?","In 5XFAD mice, microglia-specific deletion of Ifnar1 (interferon-alpha/beta receptor 1) has a significant protective effect on post-synaptic terminals. This deletion prevents post-synaptic loss, as evidenced by the restoration of PSD95+ puncta density, a marker of post-synaptic terminals, in the subiculum, CA1, and CA3 regions of the hippocampus (roy2022concertedtypei pages 6-6, 8-8). The study indicates that microglia-specific Ifnar1 deletion decreases microglial reactivity and rescues post-synaptic loss, supported by reduced microglial activation markers and improved post-synaptic puncta densities (roy2022concertedtypei pages 8-9).

Furthermore, the deletion reduces the engulfment of PSD95+ post-synaptic terminals by microglia, suggesting that IFN-I signaling in microglia is necessary for the selective elimination of these terminals (roy2022concertedtypei pages 9-11). The findings highlight that blocking IFN-I signaling can mitigate synaptic pathology, particularly in the post-synaptic compartment, which is otherwise adversely affected by IFN-I signaling in the context of amyloid β plaque-associated neurodegeneration (roy2022concertedtypei pages 11-12).

However, CWC15 does not interact with the 20 S proteasome subunit PBE1 in this context (zhou2024thespliceosomeassociatedprotein pages 4-5, 5-6). 

The interaction between CWC15 and the 20 S proteasome is crucial for facilitating the degradation of SE, which is mediated through phosphorylation by PRP4KA, thereby reducing SE's affinity to HYL1 and negatively impacting SE-mediated miRNA production (zhou2024thespliceosomeassociatedprotein pages 1-2, 5-6). CWC15's localization in both the cytoplasm and nucleus further underscores its essential role in miRNA maturation and RNA metabolism (zhou2024thespliceosomeassociatedprotein pages 5-6). 

Overall, while CWC15 interacts with several subunits of the 20 S proteasome, its lack of interaction with PBE1 is a notable aspect of its functional profile in the degradation of SE (zhou2024thespliceosomeassociatedprotein pages 4-5, 5-6).",PBE1,Same,1,CORRECT,y,1,1
"If implementing symmetric molecular dynamics as a holonomic constraint, how can Wyckoff sites be constrained?","In symmetric molecular dynamics, Wyckoff sites can be constrained using holonomic constraints that ensure particles remain in their designated positions within the symmetry of the system. This is achieved by defining a subgroup \( G' \) that includes elements of the symmetry group \( G \) which do not leave the Wyckoff position invariant, along with a projection element \( P \). The holonomic constraint is expressed as \( \sigma[q(t)] = Pq(t) - q(t) = 0 \), which guarantees that the particle remains in the Wyckoff position throughout the simulation (Cox2022 pages 2-3).

The constraint force is calculated as \( F_c = \lambda J[\sigma] = \lambda(P - I) \), where \( \lambda \) is determined to ensure \( \sigma[q(t + \Delta t)] = 0 \) (Cox2022 pages 2-3). Additionally, affine matrices that define group transformations in fractional coordinates can be utilized to implement these constraints effectively. These matrices can be sourced from the Bilbao Crystallography Server, allowing for the integration of the asymmetric unit while using ghost particles for force-field calculations (Cox2022 pages 3-4).

"I am using bleomycin to induce senescence in fibroblasts cultured. If I culture the cells on a 0.5 KPa surface, like soft acrylamide, how much bleomycin do I need to inhibit cell growth, compared to if I culture the cells on plastic?","When culturing fibroblasts on a soft 0.5 kPa substrate, such as polyacrylamide, significantly less bleomycin is required to inhibit cell growth compared to culturing on a stiff 4 GPa plastic surface. Specifically, fibroblasts on the 0.5 kPa substrate experience near-total growth arrest at a concentration of approximately 250 nM bleomycin. In contrast, fibroblasts cultured on plastic require much higher concentrations, such as 5 µM or even 50 µM, to achieve similar levels of growth inhibition (starich2024substratestiffnessmodulates pages 5-8).

The study indicates that the sensitivity of fibroblasts to bleomycin is modulated by substrate stiffness, with softer substrates leading to a higher rate of senescence induction and lower drug concentration requirements (starich2024substratestiffnessmodulates pages 8-9). This suggests that the mechanical properties of the substrate play a crucial role in the cellular response to bleomycin, affecting both the induction of senescence and the proliferation arrest (starich2024substratestiffnessmodulates pages 20-22). Thus, when using bleomycin to induce senescence in fibroblasts, the substrate stiffness should be considered to optimize drug concentration for effective growth inhibition.",You need 10x less,Same,0.805267275310934,CORRECT,n,0,0
"In human development, what portion of the early embryo most often displays a clonal imbalance, being derived primarily from a single cell of the 2-cell blastomeres?","In human development, the inner cell mass (ICM) of the early embryo most often displays a clonal imbalance, primarily derived from a single cell of the 2-cell blastomeres. Studies indicate that a significant portion of embryos exhibit this phenomenon. Specifically, computational models predict that 73.1% of embryos have at least 60% of their ICM cells derived from one 2-cell blastomere, while 31.8% have at least 80% of their ICM cells from a single blastomere (junyent2024thefirsttwo pages 10-11). 

At the 16-cell stage, 53.7% of embryos had ICM cells completely derived from just one of the two 2-cell blastomeres, and this clonal imbalance is largely maintained through subsequent stages, with only a 12% chance of reversal by the blastocyst stage (junyent2024thefirsttwo pages 11-13). Additionally, in 8-cell embryos, 29.6% showed a clonally imbalanced ICM, which increased to 44% in embryos with two asymmetric cell divisions (junyent2024thefirsttwo pages 13-14).

"In pre-commitment myeloid progenitor cells, for how many hours can estrogen be withdrawn before the cells can no longer return to their progenitor state?","In pre-commitment myeloid progenitor cells, estrogen can be withdrawn for up to 72 hours before the cells can no longer return to their progenitor state. After this period, the majority of the cells become committed to terminal differentiation, and by 96 hours, effectively all cells are fully committed and unable to revert to the progenitor state (blanco2021chromatinstatebarriers pages 13-14). 

The study indicates that during the early stages of differentiation, specifically up to approximately 40 hours after estrogen withdrawal, the process is reversible. Cells can return to their progenitor state upon reactivation of the ER-HOXA9 transcription factor (blanco2021chromatinstatebarriers pages 15-17). However, following 72 hours of estrogen withdrawal, reactivation of ER-HOXA9 fails to revert the cells to their progenitor state, marking a definitive 'point of no return' in the differentiation process (blanco2021chromatinstatebarriers pages 21-23).

This performance decline is indicative of motor function impairment associated with the MIRAS allele, which serves as a model for mitochondrial DNA maintenance disease. In addition to the rotarod performance decrease, these mice also demonstrate a 20% decrease in treadmill performance and exhibit slightly abnormal gait compared to control mice. Despite these motor deficits, the MIRAS mice are born in Mendelian proportions, maintain a normal lifespan and body weight, suggesting that the MIRAS allele primarily affects motor coordination rather than overall viability (kang2024ancestralalleleof pages 5-5).

Specifically, the KOW domain of VcRfaH exhibits a lower sequence identity of 35.8% compared to EcRfaH, yet both proteins display similar structural properties (Zuber2022 pages 18-19). Structural analysis using NMR spectroscopy suggests that the secondary structure elements of VcRfaH closely match those of auto-inhibited EcRfaH, implying comparable tertiary structures (Zuber2022 pages 3-4).

Notably, VcRfaH possesses unique features, such as a longer helix α3* and a disulfide bridge between residues C34 and C102, which are absent in EcRfaH (Zuber2022 pages 4-5). Despite these differences, both proteins are capable of switching between all-α and all-β states, indicating that VcRfaH also functions as a transformer protein (Zuber2022 pages 4-5).

"In human fibroblasts, how long should ERK activation be maintained such that senescence commitment is triggered even if ERK signaling is brought back to baseline levels at the end of the activation period?","In human fibroblasts, ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) activation must be maintained for at least 72 hours (3 days) to trigger senescence commitment. This duration is critical, as cells that experience ERK activation for this period exhibit stable growth arrest and express senescence biomarkers, even if ERK signaling is subsequently reduced to baseline levels (lopespaciencia2024asenescencerestriction pages 4-4, 10-11). 

Shorter activation periods, such as 1 or 2 days, do not lead to senescence commitment, as these cells remain negative for senescence markers and do not show a stable proliferation arrest (lopespaciencia2024asenescencerestriction pages 4-6, 6-6). The study highlights that the sustained 3-day ERK activation is necessary to surpass a senescence commitment checkpoint, indicating a bistable system where the initial signaling can lead to long-term changes in cellular behavior (lopespaciencia2024asenescencerestriction pages 8-10). 

Thus, the maintenance of ERK activation for 72 hours is essential for integrating oncogenic signals at the chromatin level, ultimately committing the cells to a senescent state (lopespaciencia2024asenescencerestriction pages 4-6, 6-6).",3-4 days,Same,0.907133559230082,CORRECT,y,1,1

They defined a symmetry group \( G \), which included symmetry operations such as rotations, reflections, and translations, and incorporated these into the sampling process of their diffusion probabilistic model (ingraham2022illuminatingproteinspace pages 66-68). 

To achieve symmetry, the authors utilized symmetric broadcasting and symmetric averaging techniques. Symmetric broadcasting involved using the entire symmetric complex as input to capture subunit interactions, while gradient updates were broadcasted globally to symmetric positions. Symmetric averaging computed updates at symmetric coordinates by averaging contributions over all symmetry operations in the group \( G \) (ingraham2022illuminatingproteinspace pages 69-71).

This was demonstrated through various genetic approaches, including morpholino (MO) and CRISPR–Cas9 mutagenesis, as well as Mendelian genetics by crossing mmp25-mutant alleles with the dragnet allele, which contains a premature stop codon in col4a5. The inactivation of col4a5 alleviates the requirement for Mmp25 in brain angiogenesis, allowing vascular ingression into the central nervous system (CNS) to proceed similarly to wild-type siblings (schevenels2024abrainspecificangiogenic pages 4-5).

Additionally, defects in brain angiogenesis in mmp25 knockout embryos can be partially rescued by inactivating col4a5 and/or col4a6. Experimental data indicate that brain angiogenesis was restored in gpr124 mutants following the inactivation of col4a5 and/or col4a6, even in the absence of Wnt–β-catenin signaling.

Additionally, attempts to use other aptamers, such as those targeting Tn antigen and GalNAc, which bind to O-linked glycans, failed to produce visible signals, reinforcing the specificity of the Neu5Ac aptamer for glycoRNA detection (ma2023spatialimagingof pages 3-4).",Neu5Ac,Same,1,CORRECT,y,1,1
Inactivation of genes involved in which of the following complexes or pathways does NOT result in resistance to colchicine in HAP1 cells?,"Inactivation of genes involved in the PRC1 and PRC2 core complexes does not result in resistance to colchicine in HAP1 cells. The chemogenetic screens conducted indicate that no component of these complexes displayed significant resistance or sensitivity to colchicine, suggesting that their inactivation does not affect colchicine response (longhurst2024theprc2.1subcomplex pages 5-6). 

Additionally, the study highlights that inactivation of genes associated with the adaptive immune system, such as BIRC6, UBA5, and USP14, leads to sensitivity to colchicine, further emphasizing the lack of resistance linked to PRC complexes (longhurst2024theprc2.1subcomplex pages 3-4). 

Moreover, while inactivation of genes involved in various cellular processes, including the amino acid starvation response, mRNA splicing, vesicle trafficking, and the Mediator complex, attenuates the cellular response to colchicine, it does not confer resistance (longhurst2024theprc2.1subcomplex pages 4-5). 

Overall, the findings suggest that pathways and complexes outside of PRC1 and PRC2 are critical for colchicine resistance in HAP1 cells, while the PRC complexes themselves do not contribute to this resistance (longhurst2024theprc2.1subcomplex pages 5-6).",SIN3 histone deacetylation,Same,0.804778958028181,CORRECT,n,0,0
Induction of a gliogenic switch via addition of PDGF-AA via neuroectoderm specification results in which of the following?,"The induction of a gliogenic switch via the addition of Platelet-Derived Growth Factor AA (PDGF-AA) during neuroectoderm specification leads to several significant outcomes in glia-enriched cortical organoids. This process initiates an early gliogenic switch in progenitor cells, resulting in rapid astrogliogenesis. By three weeks of differentiation, approximately 28–33% of the cells in the organoids transition into astroglia, which constitute 25–31% of the total cell population by eight to ten weeks (wang2024morphologicaldiversificationand pages 2-2). 

The gliogenic switch facilitates the upregulation of gliogenic factors, such as Nuclear Factor I A (NFIA), and the expression of astrocyte markers, including Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP) and HepaCAM, indicating advanced maturation of astrocytes (wang2024morphologicaldiversificationand pages 2-3). Furthermore, the resulting astrocytes exhibit increased morphological complexity, characterized by more branches and longer processes compared to those in standard forebrain organoids (wang2024morphologicaldiversificationand pages 2-3). This model not only accelerates the generation of diverse cortical neurons but also enhances the functional integration of astrocytes into the host brain, supporting robust neurogenesis and the formation of perivascular astrocytic endfeet (wang2024morphologicaldiversificationand pages 2-2).",accelerated astrogliogenesis and normal neurogenic potential,Same,0.880572776190873,CORRECT,y,1,1
"Out of all candidate proteasome substrates tested for degradation by the 20S proteasome, approximately what number of substrates undergo cleavage at both the N and C termini as opposed to just one or the other?","The context provided does not specify the number of candidate proteasome substrates that undergo cleavage at both the N and C termini compared to those cleaved at only one terminus. Multiple excerpts indicate a lack of specific numerical data regarding substrate cleavage patterns. For instance, the study by Bashore et al. emphasizes the development of macrocyclic ligands targeting the 26S proteasome and their potential for ubiquitin-independent degradation, but it does not address the specific cleavage patterns of proteasome substrates (bashore2022targeteddegradationvia pages 1-1, 2-3, 8-8, 8-9). Similarly, Truex et al. discuss the influence of N- and C-terminal sequences on degradation and the development of a machine learning model to predict proteasomal stability, yet they also do not provide data on the cleavage patterns of substrates at both termini (truex2023designofcytotoxic pages 3-4). Therefore, the available information is insufficient to determine the number of substrates cleaved at both termini versus just one.

Is doublecortin a unique marker of newly generated granule cells in the hippocampus?,"Doublecortin (DCX) is not a unique marker of newly generated granule cells in the hippocampus. While DCX is commonly associated with neuroblasts and immature granule cells, its expression is not exclusive to these populations, particularly in humans. Studies indicate that DCX is expressed in diverse neurons, including mature granule cells and GABAergic interneurons, which raises questions about its specificity as a marker for neurogenesis (franjic2022transcriptomictaxonomyand pages 2-3, 6-8, 15-15). 

In the adult human dentate gyrus, the presence of DCX-immunolabeled (DCX-IL) cells has shown inconsistencies, with some studies reporting negative results and others identifying these cells (franjic2022transcriptomictaxonomyand pages 14-15). The research found very few cells with neuroblast-like transcriptomic profiles in humans, suggesting a significantly lower presence of neurogenic cells compared to other species (franjic2022transcriptomictaxonomyand pages 14-15, 8-8). Furthermore, DCX expression in humans does not correlate with an enrichment of neuroblast markers, indicating that mature neurons can also express DCX, thus complicating its role in defining adult neurogenesis (franjic2022transcriptomictaxonomyand pages 8-8).",No,Same,0.895372934512548,CORRECT,y,1,1
Relative abundance of which molecule(s) in reactive astrocytes is associated with the decline of NAD+ levels following TNFα treatment?,"The decline of NAD+ levels in reactive astrocytes following TNFα treatment is primarily associated with the upregulation of CD38, a major NADase. CD38's cyclase/hydrolase activity contributes to the observed reduction in NAD+ levels, indicating its critical role in the metabolic response of astrocytes to inflammation (wang2024morphologicaldiversificationand pages 9-9). Following TNFα treatment, there is a significant increase in CD38 expression in reactive astrocytes, which correlates with a decline in NAD+ levels and is linked to metabolic and oxidative stress (wang2024morphologicaldiversificationand pages 8-9). 

Additionally, the study highlights that the decline in NAD+ levels is associated with changes in the NAD+/NADH ratio and the glutathione (GSH/GSSH) ratio, further emphasizing the metabolic stress induced by TNFα (wang2024morphologicaldiversificationand pages 8-8). The inhibition of CD38 activity has been shown to alleviate these stresses, reinforcing its role as a key molecule in the dysregulation of NAD+ metabolism in reactive astrocytes (wang2024morphologicaldiversificationand pages 25-30). Thus, CD38 is a central factor in the decline of NAD+ levels in this context.",CD38,Same,1,CORRECT,y,1,1
What cellular feature displays the greatest difference in morphology between apoptotic and control cells as measured by Cell Painting assays?,"The cellular feature that displays the greatest difference in morphology between apoptotic and control cells, as measured by Cell Painting assays, is mitochondrial morphology. The study identified 367 differential morphology features when comparing apoptotic cells to control cells, with significant changes primarily observed in the mitochondria and nuclei (lippincott2025amorphologyand pages 5-7). Specifically, it was noted that ""mitochondrial morphology is the cellular feature displaying the greatest difference between apoptotic and control cells,"" indicating that apoptosis induces more morphological changes in mitochondria compared to other organelles (lippincott2025amorphologyand pages 12-13).

In contrast, pyroptosis was found to alter the morphology of nuclei, actin, Golgi, and plasma membranes, highlighting distinct morphological patterns associated with different cell death pathways (lippincott2025amorphologyand pages 12-13). The Cell Painting assay, enhanced with Gasdermin D, was instrumental in mapping these morphological differences, allowing for a comprehensive analysis of single-cell morphologies across various treatments (lippincott2025amorphologyand pages 12-13).

To which segment of the UNC5B-AS1 upstream super enhancer region does FOXP3 bind?,"The specific segment of the UNC5B-AS1 upstream super enhancer region to which the transcription factor FOXP3 binds is not explicitly detailed in the available literature. The study by Zhu et al. (2024) indicates that FOXP3 interacts with the promoter region of UNC5B-AS1, forming a chromatin loop that regulates its expression in pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) under hypoxic conditions (zhu2024superenhancerdrivenlncrna pages 29-33). However, it does not specify the exact binding site within the super-enhancer region.

In contrast, the research by Zhang et al.

While it discusses FOXP3's sequence specificity and its interactions with DNA, it does not provide information on the specific segments of the UNC5B-AS1 super enhancer that FOXP3 binds to (zhang2023foxp3recognizesmicrosatellites pages 2-3).

Upregulation of which of the following was most associated with the Relapse signature in prostate cancer?,"The Relapse (RA) signature in prostate cancer is primarily associated with the upregulation of several inflammation-related genes. Key markers identified include serum amyloid A (SAA1 and SAA2), alpha-1-acid glycoprotein 1 (ORM1), immune globulins (IGHG3, IGHG4, IGKC, IGLC7), lactotransferrin (LTF), and lipocalin-2 (LCN2) (krossa2024deepphenotypingof pages 17-18). Among these, LTF was specifically linked to relapse, while LCN2 and CXCL1 were noted as prognostic markers for relapse and metastasis (krossa2024deepphenotypingof pages 17-18).

Additionally, the RA signature was characterized by the upregulation of chemokines such as CXCL1, CXCL3, CXCL5, CXCL6, CXCL11, CXCL17, and CCL20, which are enriched in Club-like cells involved in immune responses (krossa2024deepphenotypingof pages 18-19). The study also highlighted ACKR1 as the dominant receptor for CXC chemokines in relapse patients, primarily expressed by endothelial cells (krossa2024deepphenotypingof pages 11-13).

"Relative to wild type zebrafish embryos, those with Kif9 knocked down display what ciliary phenotype?","Zebrafish embryos with Kif9 knocked down (Kif9-KD) exhibit several notable ciliary phenotypes compared to wild type embryos. The most significant changes include a substantial reduction in ciliary beat frequency, with some cilia being paralyzed and others displaying slower beat frequencies (konjikusic2022kif9isan pages 3-3). Additionally, the cilia in Kif9-KD embryos are shorter than those in controls, indicating a disruption in ciliary structure (konjikusic2022kif9isan pages 3-3).

The localization of essential ciliary proteins, such as Rsph10b, Spag16, and Cfap74, is also significantly impaired at the distal ends of motile cilia in Kif9-KD embryos. This reduction in protein localization is not attributed to cilia length but rather to a specific loss of these proteins at the distal axoneme (konjikusic2022kif9isan pages 3-4). Furthermore, the study reveals that Kif9 is critical for the proper proximodistal patterning of radial spokes and dynein arms, which are vital for ciliary function (konjikusic2022kif9isan pages 4-5). Overall, these findings underscore the essential role of Kif9 in maintaining ciliary structure and function in zebrafish embryos (konjikusic2022kif9isan pages 6-7).",Shorter cilia,Different,0.908967204521678,INCORRECT,y,0,1
Removal of the sialic acid moieties from the T-cell surfaces does what to the binding of Sialic acid-binding Ig-like lectin 15 to human T-cells?,"Removal of sialic acid moieties from the surfaces of T-cells significantly reduces the binding of Sialic acid-binding Ig-like lectin 15 (Siglec-15) to these cells. The presence of α(2,3)- and α(2,6)-linked sialoglycans is crucial for the interaction between Siglec-15 and T-cells, as demonstrated by binding assays (lenza2023structuralinsightsinto pages 1-1, 1-2). Experimental treatments, such as the application of neuraminidase A, which specifically removes sialic acid moieties, have shown a comparable decrease in Siglec-15 binding to T-cells, akin to the effects of complete deglycosylation (lenza2023structuralinsightsinto pages 2-3). 

Furthermore, the substitution of a key residue (R143A) in Siglec-15's binding pocket abolishes its ability to bind sialic acids, preventing interaction with CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells (lenza2023structuralinsightsinto pages 3-3). Antibody-mediated blockade of Siglec-15's sialic acid-binding site also confirms that the removal of sialic acid moieties disrupts its binding to T-cells (lenza2023structuralinsightsinto pages 3-3).

This chemokine interacts with the venular capillary marker ACKR1 (Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines) on VE3 vascular endothelial cells in diseased skin. VE3 cells, which constitute approximately 2% of endothelial cells in the adult dermis, are characterized by high expression of ACKR1 and coexpress various inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and leukocyte adhesion molecules, including IL6, IL33, SELE, and ICAM1 (reynolds2021developmentalcellprograms pages 10-10). The interaction between CXCL8 and ACKR1 facilitates leukocyte adhesion, migration, and recruitment, contributing significantly to the pathogenesis of inflammatory skin diseases (reynolds2021developmentalcellprograms pages 10-11). Advanced techniques such as whole-mount immunostaining and CellPhoneDB receptor-ligand database analysis have confirmed the close apposition and interaction of VE3 and Mac2 in inflamed skin, underscoring their roles in immune cell dynamics (reynolds2021developmentalcellprograms pages 10-11).",ACKR1,Same,1,CORRECT,y,1,1
What effect does bone marrow stromal cell-conditioned media have on the expression of the CD8a receptor in cultured OT-1 T cells?,"Bone marrow stromal cell-conditioned media (SCM) does not significantly alter the expression of the CD8α receptor in cultured OT-1 T cells. Studies indicated that after 24 hours of treatment with SCM, there was no significant difference in CD8α expression compared to unconditioned media (UCM) (kellner2024thetcellniche pages 3-5). Additionally, while a trend towards increased CD8α expression was observed in adipocyte-conditioned media (ACM), SCM did not show a similar effect (kellner2024thetcellniche pages 5-6).

Further analysis revealed that SCM significantly enhances T-cell mechanics, increasing T-cell receptor (TCR) tension signals and the ability of T cells to exert higher forces, but specific data on CD8α receptor expression was not provided (kellner2024thetcellniche pages 11-14). Moreover, SCM was shown to increase cytokine production and expression of other activation markers, but the direct impact on CD8α expression remains unaddressed in the provided data (kellner2024thetcellniche pages 2-3).

What effect does a F200Y mutation in fungal β-tubulin have on binding of the anti-fungal drug thiabendazole?,"The F200Y mutation in fungal β-tubulin significantly impacts the binding of the anti-fungal drug thiabendazole (TBZ). This mutation alters the binding conformation of TBZ, leading to reduced efficacy and resistance to the drug. In wild-type β-tubulin, TBZ exhibits a favorable binding affinity with a contact energy of -9.9 kcal/mol, forming polar contacts with residues E198 and Q134, and arene-hydrogen interactions with F200, L250, and L253. However, the F200Y mutation introduces unfavorable steric repulsions (+27.6 kcal/mol) due to steric clashes and altered hydrogen bonding, particularly involving Y200, F240, L250, and L253, which constricts the binding pocket and occludes TBZ binding (garge2021discoveryofnew pages 5-6).

Strains with the F200Y mutation, such as those humanized with TUBB4, are predicted to be resistant to TBZ and can grow normally in its presence, indicating that this mutation disrupts TBZ binding (garge2021discoveryofnew pages 6-7).

What effect does expression of the ATPase-deficient E251Q mutant of the Spindle E protein in silkworm cells have on the levels of the mature piwiRNAs piR1712 and piR2986?,"The expression of the ATPase-deficient E251Q mutant of the Spindle E protein (Spn-E-EQ) in silkworm cells leads to a reduction in the levels of mature piwiRNAs, specifically piR1712 and piR2986. This reduction is accompanied by an accumulation of their precursor RNAs (pre-piRNAs), indicating a disruption in the maturation process of these piRNAs (izumi2024thedualrole pages 10-11). The study suggests that the Spn-E-EQ mutant forms an aberrantly stable complex with BmAgo3 and Siwi, which inhibits the handover of BmAgo3-cleaved RNA fragments to Siwi, thereby preventing the proper maturation of piRNAs (izumi2024thedualrole pages 10-11).

Furthermore, the ATPase activity of Spn-E is critical for the production of Siwi-bound piRNAs during the ping-pong amplification cycle. The E251Q mutation disrupts this ATPase function, leading to an increase in A→S pre-piRNAs and impairing the levels of mature piRNAs such as piR1712 and piR2986 (izumi2024thedualrole pages 15-17; izumi2024thedualrole pages 44-45).

What is the effect on KRAB domain function when it is concatenated with a domain that is poorly expressed?,"When the KRAB (Kruppel-associated box) domain is concatenated with poorly expressed domains, its repressive function is significantly inhibited. Specifically, domains such as DHX16 OB_NTP and BAZ1A DDT, when paired with KRAB, lead to a loss of silencing ability at lower doxycycline (dox) concentrations (100 ng/mL). However, increasing the dox concentration to 1000 ng/mL can partially or fully restore KRAB's silencing capability. This suggests that the diminished function of KRAB in these instances is primarily due to decreased protein abundance resulting from the poorly expressed domains (mukund2022highthroughputfunctionalcharacterization pages 8-9).

Additionally, the study indicates that the KRAB domain generally maintains its repressive function when paired with most domains, but its effectiveness is compromised when concatenated with domains that exhibit decreased expression (mukund2022highthroughputfunctionalcharacterization pages 10-11).

What is the contact probability of active promoters with the nearest topologically associated domain (TAD) in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs)?,"In mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), the contact probability of active promoters with the nearest topologically associated domain (TAD) boundary varies significantly. Approximately 75% of active promoters exhibit contact probabilities lower than 0.2 with the nearest TAD boundary, indicating that these promoters are insulated from the TAD boundary effects (zuin2022nonlinearcontrolof pages 6-7). Conversely, a subset of active promoters located closer to or adjacent to TAD boundaries shows higher contact probabilities, which suggests a less sensitive transcriptional response (zuin2022nonlinearcontrolof pages 6-7).

Further analysis reveals that the contact probability for active promoters outside the TAD is higher than 0.001 for a subset of these promoters (zuin2022nonlinearcontrolof pages 16-17).

While PITPnm1 is widely expressed in mammals, including neural tissues, its specific function in healthy mammalian neural stem cells remains unclear. The literature indicates that PITPnm1 plays a role in resupplying PtdIns during receptor-stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis, which is critical for cellular signaling pathways, including diacylglycerol (DAG) and calcium responses (lete2020lipidtransferproteins pages 12-13).

Despite its involvement in lipid signaling, studies show that PITPnm1 nullizygous mice are viable and fertile, exhibiting no obvious phenotype, suggesting that PITPNM1 may not be essential for viability and could have functional redundancy with other members of the PITP family, such as PITPnm2 or PITPnm3 (lete2020lipidtransferproteins pages 13-14).

What is the effect on firing rate of parvalbumin-expressing interneurons in the barrel cortex of adult mice when the SMAD1 is deleted?,"The deletion of SMAD1 in parvalbumin-expressing (PV) interneurons in the barrel cortex of adult mice leads to a significant reduction in their firing rate. Specifically, the firing rate of these interneurons is reduced due to a decrease in input resistance in Smad1ΔPV cells, which results in decreased excitability and less glutamatergic input (okur2024controlofneuronal pages 6-7). This reduction in firing rate disrupts the cortical excitation–inhibition balance, contributing to hyperactivity and spontaneous seizures in Smad1ΔPV mice (okur2024controlofneuronal pages 6-7).

Additionally, the intrinsic properties of PV interneurons, such as resting membrane potential and maximum firing frequency, are altered in Smad1-deficient mice compared to control mice (okur2024controlofneuronal pages 21-28). The study also notes that the density of glutamatergic synapses on these interneurons is reduced by approximately 40%, which correlates with a decrease in the frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) (okur2024controlofneuronal pages 5-5).

What is the mechanism for expression of the EPRS1(N1) form of EPRS1 in humans?,"The mechanism for the expression of the EPRS1(N1) form of EPRS1 in humans is not explicitly detailed in the available literature. However, it is known that the EPRS1(N1) variant arises from a novel polyadenylation event that introduces a new stop codon, resulting in a truncated C-terminus (lee2023phosphocodedependentglutamylprolyltrnasynthetase pages 4-5). This truncated form is significant for maintaining cellular homeostasis by preserving a basal level of GAIT (gamma-interferon-activated inhibitor of translation) gene expression in myeloid cells. It inhibits the binding of the GAIT complex to target mRNAs, thereby regulating the expression of GAIT target proteins, such as VEGF-A, which is crucial for vessel maintenance and tumor growth suppression (lee2023phosphocodedependentglutamylprolyltrnasynthetase pages 4-5).

While the specific regulatory mechanisms governing the expression of EPRS1(N1) remain unclear, the literature suggests that EPRS1 is influenced by various post-translational modifications and proteolytic cleavage, which may play a role in the generation of specific EPRS1 forms (lee2023phosphocodedependentglutamylprolyltrnasynthetase pages 5-5).

What percentage of colorectal cancer-associated fibroblasts typically survive at 2 weeks if cultured with the platinum-based chemotherapy oxaliplatin?,"The survival percentage of colorectal cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) when cultured with the platinum-based chemotherapy drug oxaliplatin for 2 weeks is not explicitly stated in the available context. However, it is noted that approximately 50–80% of CAFs survived after 12 days of treatment, which suggests a significant level of resistance to oxaliplatin compared to cancer cells, which did not survive beyond 9 days of treatment (linares2023longtermplatinumbaseddrug pages 2-2). 

The study indicates that CAFs maintain their abundance and viability even after exposure to oxaliplatin, demonstrating higher survival rates than other cell types, including cancer, endothelial, and immune cells (linares2023longtermplatinumbaseddrug pages 2-3). Although the exact percentage of fibroblast survival at 2 weeks is not provided, the findings highlight the accumulation of platinum in CAFs and its implications for colorectal cancer progression and therapy resistance (linares2023longtermplatinumbaseddrug pages 1-2).

What is the substrate preference of the Ddd1 deaminase?,"The Ddd1 deaminase exhibits a substrate preference for double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) cytidine deamination, specifically favoring 5’-GC motifs. Structural analysis indicates that Ddd1 belongs to a subclade of the SCP1.201 clade, sharing a core structure with DddA, a known double-stranded DNA cytosine base editor (DdCBE) (huang2023discoveryofnew pages 6-8). Functional evaluations in HEK293T cells demonstrated that Ddd1, along with other proteins in its subclade, can perform dsDNA base editing (huang2023discoveryofnew pages 6-8).

Further experiments revealed that Ddd1 has distinct editing patterns compared to DddA, showing higher activity at 5’-GC motifs (huang2023discoveryofnew pages 8-10). This preference was confirmed through sequence motif logos generated from base conversion frequencies, which highlighted Ddd1's specificity for these substrates (huang2023discoveryofnew pages 8-10). Additionally, Ddd1's editing efficiencies and sequence motif preferences were analyzed in the context of genomic target sites, reinforcing its preference for the 'NC10N' motif (huang2023discoveryofnew pages 21-24).

"When a large excess of membrane protein substrate (Vamp2) is added to the wild-type Get3/4/5 chaperone complex, the complex dissociates into two components. Which component does the substrate bind to?","When a large excess of the membrane protein substrate Vamp2 is added to the wild-type Get3/4/5 chaperone complex, the substrate specifically binds to the Get3 component of the complex. This interaction leads to the dissociation of the Get4/5 tetramer from the substrate-bound Get3, indicating that the binding occurs primarily at the Get3 interface (faizi2022avesiclemicrorheometer pages 6-7). 

The Get3/4/5 chaperone complex is responsible for targeting C-terminal tail-anchored membrane proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The complex forms a hexameric structure, and upon substrate binding, the Get3 dimer undergoes a conformational change that triggers the dissociation of the entire complex into its individual components (faizi2022avesiclemicrorheometer pages 1-1, faizi2022avesiclemicrorheometer pages 8-9). 

Furthermore, the substrate transfer to Get3 results in the dissolution of the complex, reinforcing the notion that Get3 is the primary binding site for the substrate (faizi2022avesiclemicrorheometer pages 7-7). This mechanism highlights the critical role of Get3 in the process of substrate binding and transfer to the ER membrane.",Get3,Same,1,CORRECT,y,1,1

This temperature was determined through experimental analysis of EF-1A stability and GDP-binding properties, serving as a proxy for the optimal growth temperature (OGT) of this archaeal group (lu2024evolutionofoptimal pages 3-4).

Additionally, the study infers that the optimal growth temperature for GDP binding by EF-1A in Wukongarchaeia is approximately 63.2 °C, with a 90% confidence interval of 54.8–65.6 °C. This suggests that Wukongarchaeia are classified as moderate thermophiles, consistent with the broader findings regarding the temperature dependence of GDP binding in Asgard archaea (lu2024evolutionofoptimal pages 3-3).

The research also indicates that the ancestral EF-1A protein exhibited an optimal GDP-binding temperature of 49.4 °C, with a 90% confidence interval of 45.8–50.1 °C, based on experimental data and modeling (lu2024evolutionofoptimal pages 2-2).

The binding is primarily mediated by the HRYxGW motif of MC1, which is critical for the interaction with PSMD2 (bashore2022targeteddegradationvia pages 2-3). Notably, MC1H7 forms polar contacts with the side chain of PSMD2E336 and the backbone carbonyls of PSMD2P871 and PSMD2L873. Additionally, the neighboring residue MC1R8 establishes a charge interaction with PSMD2E878 and forms hydrogen bonds with PSMD2H868, PSMD2K773, and PSMD2N737 (bashore2022targeteddegradationvia pages 4-4).

This analysis encompassed various non-genic regions, including antisense and intergenic windows. However, the percentage of non-genic windows displaying transcription at more stringent thresholds was not specified.

Further analysis indicated that evolved clones exhibited an average of 347.3 non-genic windows transcribed at greater than 5 TPM, compared to 254.5 in ancestral clones, suggesting a significant increase in transcriptional activity over time (uzzaman2023promotercapturedrives pages 6-8).

Immunofluorescence microscopy studies indicate that Rv2780 is detected in the cytoplasm of mice peritoneal macrophages (MPMs) during infection, suggesting its secretion into host cells (peng2024mycobacteriumtuberculosissuppresses pages 2-3). Additionally, Rv2780 is found partially in mitochondria, with minimal presence in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or lysosomes (peng2024mycobacteriumtuberculosissuppresses pages 2-2). 

The localization of Rv2780 was analyzed using various staining techniques, including MitoTracker and LysoTracker, to assess subcellular localization in infected macrophages (peng2024mycobacteriumtuberculosissuppresses pages 14-14).

"When using protein language models to predict the effect of mutations in fitness of adeno-associated virus 2, does fine-tuning give a larger gain for the ESM2, T5, or Ankh models?","In the context of predicting the effects of mutations on the fitness of adeno-associated virus 2 (AAV2), fine-tuning protein language models (pLMs) yields varying performance gains across different models. The study indicates that fine-tuning significantly improved the performance of the Ankh models, particularly for mutational landscape data, including AAV2, compared to the ESM2 and ProtT5 models. Specifically, the Ankh models demonstrated a larger gain from fine-tuning for AAV mutation fitness prediction (schmirler2023finetuningproteinlanguage pages 2-3).

While all models benefited from fine-tuning, the extent of improvement was notably greater for Ankh, which is attributed to its architecture and pretraining on similar datasets. The ESM2 and ProtT5 models also showed improvements, but these were not as pronounced as those observed with the Ankh models (schmirler2023finetuningproteinlanguage pages 1-2).

Approximately 21% of the predicted proteins in Borg genomes have the best matches to proteins of Archaea, with the largest group specifically matching Methanoperedens spp. This indicates a significant contribution of lateral gene transfer from these organisms to the Borg genomes (alshayeb2022borgsaregiant pages 2-2). 

Additionally, the majority of proteins in the Borg genomes are categorized as 'Unknown,' suggesting that while there is a notable representation of Methanoperedens-related genes, a substantial portion of the genetic content remains uncharacterized (alshayeb2022borgsaregiant pages 12-14). The presence of genes encoding glycosyltransferases further emphasizes the potential metabolic roles of Borgs, particularly in relation to their host organisms (alshayeb2022borgsaregiant pages 3-4).

Which bioconjugation system is used to attach the INT tag to AAVs in the Vault AAV delivery system?,"The Vault AAV (VAAV) delivery system utilizes the SpyTag-SpyCatcher bioconjugation system to attach the INT tag to adeno-associated viruses (AAVs). Specifically, SpyTag003 (SpT3) is genetically inserted into the VP2 protein of AAV9, creating a modified AAV9 that can interact with the SpyCatcher003-INT (SpC3-INT) fusion protein. This fusion protein features a flexible linker connecting the SpyCatcher003 and the INT peptide, facilitating the spontaneous formation of complexes known as AAV9-INT (collins2024encapsulationofaavs pages 2-3, 3-5).

The SpyTag-SpyCatcher system enables site-specific conjugation, which is critical for the successful assembly of the VAAV delivery system. This method allows the INT peptide to bind to the interior of the vault nanoparticles, thereby enabling the encapsulation of AAVs within these protein structures (collins2024encapsulationofaavs pages 7-8, 8-10).

Which of the following domains is critical in mediating NLRP3 inflammasome oligomerization?,"The FISNA (fish-specific NACHT-associated) domain is critical in mediating NLRP3 inflammasome oligomerization. Structural changes within the FISNA domain, such as the formation of helix 2 and the ordering of loop 1 in the active conformation, significantly contribute to this process (xiao2022cryoemstructuresof pages 3-4). The FISNA domain facilitates interactions between neighboring NLRP3 molecules, with specific loops engaging in electrostatically driven interactions that stabilize the oligomeric structure (xiao2022cryoemstructuresof pages 3-4). 

Key residues within the FISNA domain, including R147, E152, N155, R157, K166, and E176, have been identified as essential for NLRP3 inflammasome function. Mutations in these residues impair caspase-1 processing, underscoring their importance in the oligomerization process (xiao2022cryoemstructuresof pages 4-4). Additionally, residues I174 and V200 stabilize the FISNA domain in its active conformation, further elucidating the mechanism of NLRP3 activation and oligomerization (xiao2022cryoemstructuresof pages 4-5).

Which amino acids of yeast Rev7 are not important for its interaction with the MRX complex?,"The specific amino acids of yeast Rev7 that are not important for its interaction with the MRX complex have not been explicitly identified in the available literature. However, it is established that the N-terminal HORMA domain (residues 1-149) is dispensable for this interaction. Experimental evidence indicates that N-terminally truncated variants of Rev7 support robust yeast cell growth, suggesting that these residues do not play a critical role in binding to the MRX subunits (Mre11, Rad50, and Xrs2) (badugu2024<i>saccharomycescerevisiae<i>rev7promotes pages 7-9). 

In contrast, the C-terminal 42-amino acid segment (residues 203-245) is crucial for the interaction, as its deletion results in the loss of cell proliferation and growth (badugu2024<i>saccharomycescerevisiae<i>rev7promotes pages 6-7). While the context suggests that residues outside this C-terminal segment may not be critical, it does not provide specific details on which other amino acids are non-essential (badugu2024<i>saccharomycescerevisiae<i>rev7promotes pages 15-17).

Which antibody isotype is NOT produced in HLA-expressing mice by the AMP-CpG formulated EBV vaccine for gp350-specific antibodies?,"The AMP-CpG formulated Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) vaccine induces a variety of antibody isotypes in HLA-expressing mice, specifically targeting the gp350 antigen. The study indicates that the vaccine generates a mixture of antibody isotypes, including IgA, IgM, IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b, and IgG3 (dasari2023lymphnodetargeted pages 12-12). However, it does not specify any antibody isotype that is completely absent in response to the vaccine.

Further analysis reveals that while the vaccine promotes robust IgG responses, particularly anti-gp350 IgG antibodies, it does not significantly elevate IgM and IgG3 titers compared to the soluble CpG control group (dasari2023lymphnodetargeted pages 6-7). This suggests that while IgM and IgG3 are produced, their levels do not show a significant increase due to the AMP-CpG formulation.

In summary, the context does not explicitly state that any specific antibody isotype is entirely absent; however, it implies that IgM and IgG3 are not significantly elevated by the vaccine compared to controls (dasari2023lymphnodetargeted pages 6-7).

Which of the following epigenetic changes can be expected when male valvular interstitial cells (VIC) are cultured on larger polystyrene nanoparticles gels but not on smaller polystyrene nanoparticles gels?,"When male valvular interstitial cells (VICs) are cultured on larger polystyrene nanoparticle (PS-NP) hydrogels, several distinct epigenetic changes can be observed that are not present when cultured on smaller PS-NP gels. Notably, male VICs exhibit increased acetylation states specifically associated with larger PS-NPs (2000 nm), which is hypothesized to drive the expression of osteoblast-associated genes (gorashi2024ychromosomelinked pages 5-6). In contrast, smaller PS-NPs (200 nm) do not induce this increase in acetylation.

Additionally, male VICs show a consistent trend of decreased global methylation when exposed to larger PS-NPs, a change that is not observed with smaller particles (gorashi2024ychromosomelinked pages 7-8). This decrease in methylation is linked to the activity of the Y-linked UTY demethylase, which modulates male-specific methylation states in response to extracellular cues (gorashi2024ychromosomelinked pages 23-27). Furthermore, transcriptomic analyses indicate that larger PS-NPs lead to differential gene expression and pathway activation, including increased nuclear localization of Runx2, which is further influenced by the nanoscale stiffness of the hydrogels (gorashi2024ychromosomelinked pages 27-36).

Pro313 is specifically noted for its role in the structural alteration that allows the mutant to project its central bulky amino acid into the HDAC1 active site, thereby promoting neomorphic interactions and oncogenic activity (xie2024kbtbd4cancerhotspot pages 7-8). 

Arg312 is highlighted as a critical contributor to the interaction with HDAC1, as it protrudes significantly into the HDAC1 active site tunnel, facilitating essential hotspot interactions (xie2024kbtbd4cancerhotspot pages 6-7). Additionally, the positively charged side chain of Arg312 reaches halfway into the tunnel, while Arg314 occupies a nearby vestibule, indicating their distinct roles in the interaction with HDAC1 (xie2024kbtbd4cancerhotspot pages 5-6).

Additionally, the study highlights that residues outside the canonical SH3-binding motif, such as Q(-14), H(-10), and I(-9), also contribute to the interaction with Sho1. These residues interact with specific hydrophobic residues on the non-SH3 surface of Sho1, indicating that mutations in these distal residues can significantly affect binding strength (jordan2024residuesneighboringan pages 13-14). 

Moreover, the research suggests that mutations in the extended binding motif of Pbs2 can enhance interactions by allowing residues to engage with a hydrophobic pocket formed by both SH3 and non-SH3 regions of Sho1 (jordan2024residuesneighboringan pages 18-19).

The overall analysis of protein associations highlights that the D20V mutation impacts the binding of several key proteins involved in U-snRNP assembly, with SmD1 being the most significantly affected (matera2024chaperoningthechaperones pages 4-5). 

In summary, SmD1 is identified as having the greatest reduction in association with the D20V mutant SMN protein, underscoring its critical role in the SMN complex and the effects of the mutation on protein interactions (matera2024chaperoningthechaperones pages 27-29).",SmD1,Same,1,CORRECT,y,1,1
Which of the following mutations in the native nanobody targeting the RBD of the spike domain of SARS-Cov-2 pulls the CDR2 loop closer to RBD in computational models?,"The mutation of Gly56 to His56 in the native nanobody targeting the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 has been identified as a factor that pulls the CDR2 loop closer to the RBD in computational models. This structural change was observed through PyMol analysis, which indicated that the mutation caused Gly55 to move towards Gly482 of the RBD, thereby enhancing the interaction between the nanobody and the RBD (singh2024enhancingaffinityof pages 14-16).

Additionally, the mutation Ser54 to Glu (S54E) demonstrated a favorable HADDOCK score and the highest number of hydrogen bonds (14), suggesting it may also contribute to pulling the CDR2 loop closer to the RBD (singh2024enhancingaffinityof pages 34-36). Other mutations in the CDR2 loop, such as S54R, S54N, and S54D, also showed improved binding characteristics, indicating their potential role in optimizing the nanobody's affinity for the RBD (singh2024enhancingaffinityof pages 12-14).

Overall, the mutations Gly56His and Ser54Glu are significant in enhancing the structural positioning of the CDR2 loop relative to the RBD, thereby improving the binding affinity of the nanobody (singh2024enhancingaffinityof pages 39-44).",G56H,Same,0.7,INCORRECT,y,0,1
Which of the following mutations in the SARS-CoV2 BA.1 spike protein has been shown to increase antibody neutralization potency?,"The mutation S446G in the SARS-CoV-2 BA.1 spike protein has been identified as enhancing the neutralization potency of antibodies, including the modified antibody 2130-1-0114-112. This mutation likely contributes to increased neutralization efficacy against the BA.2 variant as well (desautels2024computationallyrestoringthe pages 5-5). 

Additionally, specific mutations in the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) of antibodies have been shown to strengthen interactions with the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein. Notably, the mutations S32A and S33A in the CDRL1 region enhance hydrophobic interactions, while the T59E mutation in the CDRL2 loop establishes a new salt bridge with the Q498R substitution in the Omicron RBD, further improving antibody interactions (desautels2024computationallyrestoringthe pages 5-6). 

The study emphasizes that these mutations in the spike protein are critical for enhancing antibody neutralization potency, although the specific mutations responsible for improvements in the antibody's performance were not explicitly listed (desautels2024computationallyrestoringthe pages 10-13). Overall, the findings underscore the importance of targeted mutations in both the spike protein and antibodies for effective neutralization against SARS-CoV-2 variants.",S446G,Same,1,CORRECT,y,1,1
Which of the following genes does TNN interact with?,"The tenascin (TN) family of extracellular matrix (ECM) glycoproteins, particularly tenascin-R (TN-R) and tenascin-C (TN-C), are involved in various cellular interactions and signaling pathways. TN-R interacts with several ligands, including neurofascin, Nr-CAM, axonin-1, and F11/contactin, which influence cell attachment and neurite outgrowth (jones2000thetenascinfamily pages 7-7). Additionally, TN-R is known to bind with myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), neurocan, phosphacan, and lecticans such as brevican, aggrecan, and versican, contributing to processes like neurite outgrowth and cell adhesion (jones2000thetenascinfamily pages 6-7).

While the context provides extensive information on TN-R's interactions, it does not explicitly mention direct interactions of the TNN gene with other genes. However, it highlights that TN-R knockout mice exhibit abnormal optic nerve conduction and misexpression of phosphacan, indicating a complex relationship with signaling pathways (jones2000thetenascinfamily pages 17-17). The TN-X gene, located on human chromosome 6, is associated with various conditions but lacks specific interaction details with other genes (jones2000thetenascinfamily pages 3-3).

Which of the following is not activated in macrophages upon Il-4 stimulation?,"The context provided does not specify any transcription factors or genes that are not activated in macrophages upon Interleukin-4 (IL-4) stimulation. The excerpts primarily focus on the transcription factors activated by IL-4, such as STAT6, cMYC, EGR2, and the PPARγ/RXR heterodimer, which are involved in alternative macrophage activation (nagy2024lineagedeterminingtranscriptionfactordriven pages 2-2). 

Additionally, while other transcription factors like ATF4, NRF2, and ATF3 are mentioned in relation to different stimuli, there is no direct mention of their activation status in response to IL-4 (nagy2024lineagedeterminingtranscriptionfactordriven pages 2-3). The study emphasizes the role of lineage-determining transcription factors (LDTFs) and signal-dependent transcription factors (SDTFs) in macrophage gene expression but does not provide a list of factors that are not activated by IL-4 (nagy2024lineagedeterminingtranscriptionfactordriven pages 1-2).

"Which of the following subunits of the Rev1 protein, when knocked out in Drosophila that also lack the Rev3 domain of polymerase zeta, lead to the greatest increase in sensitivity to DNA alkylation induced by methyl methanesulfonate?","In Drosophila melanogaster, the knockout of the Rev1-DTD (deoxycytidyl transferase domain) subunit, in the context of a Rev3 domain-deficient background, results in the greatest increase in sensitivity to DNA alkylation damage induced by methyl methanesulfonate (MMS). This heightened sensitivity is comparable to that observed in complete Rev1 knockouts (rev1∆null) (khodaverdian2024rev1coordinatesa pages 11-13). The study indicates that the Rev1-DTD domain is essential for inserting cytosine opposite damaged guanines and abasic sites, particularly when polymerase zeta (pol ζ) is absent (khodaverdian2024rev1coordinatesa pages 13-16). 

In contrast, knockouts of other domains of Rev1, such as the BRCT and UBM domains, also lead to increased sensitivity to MMS but to a lesser extent than the Rev1-DTD knockout (khodaverdian2024rev1coordinatesa pages 11-13). The findings underscore the critical role of the DTD domain in the DNA damage tolerance mechanism, particularly in the absence of pol ζ, highlighting its importance in maintaining genomic stability under alkylation stress (khodaverdian2024rev1coordinatesa pages 5-7).",DTD,Same,1,CORRECT,y,1,1
Which of the following synthetically designed matrix proteins produces the thickest fibers?,"I cannot answer. The provided context does not contain specific information regarding the thickness of fibers produced by synthetically designed matrix proteins.

The excerpt from Jimenez et al. (2024) mentions engineered living materials and protein-based materials but does not provide a direct comparison of fiber thickness among these synthetically designed matrix proteins (jimenez2024geneticallymodifyingthe pages 20-22).

Which transcription factor has been found to be enriched in heart and skeletal muscle of Rattus norvegicus rats that have undergone endurance training?,"The study on the multi-omic response to endurance exercise training in Rattus norvegicus identified several transcription factors involved in muscle adaptation. Notably, the Mef2 family transcription factor motifs, particularly MEF2C, were enriched in the heart and skeletal muscle tissues of rats that underwent endurance training. MEF2C plays a crucial role in muscle cell differentiation and has implications in vascular development and neuron differentiation (amar2024temporaldynamicsof pages 3-3).

Additionally, the research highlighted other transcription factors such as SP1, KLF3, and KLF4, although it did not specify a singular transcription factor that was exclusively enriched in both heart and skeletal muscle (amar2024temporaldynamicsof pages 3-4). The study emphasized that 67% of the genes exhibited tissue-specific responses, indicating a complex regulatory network in response to endurance training (amar2024temporaldynamicsof pages 5-5). However, the specific transcription factor enriched in both tissues was not explicitly stated in the provided excerpts (amar2024temporaldynamicsof pages 5-6). 

In summary, while MEF2C is a key transcription factor associated with endurance training adaptations, the context does not provide a definitive answer regarding a singular enriched transcription factor across both heart and skeletal muscle.",MEF2C,Same,1,CORRECT,y,1,1
Which one of the following residues in the intrinsically disordered region of RNA binding protein Unkempt silences it's transcriptional activity when mutated to alanine?,"In the intrinsically disordered region (IDR) of the RNA-binding protein Unkempt (UNK), specific residues play a crucial role in its transcriptional activity. Notably, mutating the residues L522, W622, and F625 to alanine has been shown to completely silence the transcriptional activities of these regions. The combined mutation, referred to as UNK3M (L522A/W622A/F625A), silenced not only the IDR but also the full-length UNK protein, indicating the critical importance of these residues in maintaining UNK's functional role (shah2024regulationbythe pages 2-3).

Among these, W622 is particularly significant, as it is essential for binding to the CCR4-NOT complex. Mutating W622 to alanine significantly reduces the binding affinity to the NOT module, thereby impairing UNK's transcriptional activity (shah2024regulationbythe pages 4-4). Additionally, other residues such as V511, I515, and L522, when mutated to glutamates, also impair UNK's ability to recruit the NOT module, further emphasizing the importance of these residues in UNK's function (shah2024regulationbythe pages 4-5). Overall, these findings highlight the critical role of specific residues in the IDR of UNK in regulating its transcriptional activity.",L522,Same,1,CORRECT,y,1,1
Which of the following ribosomal RNA modification enzymes have been found to promote large ribosomal subunit assembly even when expressed as a catalytically dead mutant?,"Several ribosomal RNA modification enzymes have been identified to promote large ribosomal subunit (LSU) assembly in *Escherichia coli* even when expressed as catalytically dead mutants. Notably, RlmB and RlmL have been shown to facilitate LSU assembly independently of their methylation activities. The catalytically inactive variant of RlmB, RlmB(E198A), stimulates 50S ribosomal subunit assembly, indicating a methylation-independent role (ero2024ribosomalrnamodification pages 12-12). Similarly, the methylase-inactive variant of RlmL, RlmL(N309A), promotes LSU assembly to the same extent as its functional counterpart (ero2024ribosomalrnamodification pages 12-12).

In contrast, the catalytically inactive variant of RlmN, RlmN(C355A), does not stimulate ribosome assembly, suggesting that the methylation of A2503 by RlmN is crucial for LSU assembly (ero2024ribosomalrnamodification pages 8-8). Additionally, other enzymes such as RlmE may also promote LSU assembly independently of their methylase activity, indicating potential functional redundancy among RNA modification enzymes (ero2024ribosomalrnamodification pages 1-2). Overall, RlmB and RlmL are confirmed to facilitate LSU assembly in their catalytically inactive forms, while RlmN requires its catalytic activity for effective assembly.",RlmB,Same,1,CORRECT,,0,0
Which of the following training characteristics within the target brain region could explain inter individual differences in clinical response to real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging neurofeedback in patients with major depressive disorder?,"The study on real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging neurofeedback (rtfMRI-NF) in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) indicates that training characteristics within the target brain region, specifically the left amygdala, do not explain inter-individual differences in clinical response. Key findings reveal that measures such as mean neurofeedback (NF) signal amplitude, mean left amygdala activation, and changes in left amygdala response were not significantly associated with changes in depressive symptoms, as measured by the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) (misaki2024clinicalresponseto pages 10-11, misaki2024clinicalresponseto pages 13-15).

Instead, the study emphasizes that significant associations were found between subtypes of whole-brain activation patterns during NF training and changes in MADRS scores. This suggests that the therapeutic effects of NF are more closely related to large-scale brain activity patterns rather than specific characteristics of the target region (misaki2024clinicalresponseto pages 15-17, misaki2024clinicalresponseto pages 17-18). The findings highlight the importance of the regulation process itself and indicate that inter-individual differences in clinical response may involve factors beyond age, sex, or baseline depressive severity (misaki2024clinicalresponseto pages 17-18).",None of the above,Same,0.826606584151689,CORRECT,y,1,1
Which three residues with evolutionary divergence in the G domains of RAS isoforms also impose selectivity constraints of pan-KRAS non-covalent inhibition?,"The three residues with evolutionary divergence in the G domains of RAS isoforms that impose selectivity constraints on pan-KRAS non-covalent inhibition are H95, P121, and S122. These residues are critical for the selective inhibition of KRAS over other RAS isoforms, such as HRAS and NRAS. Specifically, H95 contributes to orthosteric effects through its position in the α3 helix, while P121 and S122 exert allosteric effects from their location in loop 8 (kim2023pankrasinhibitordisables pages 3-3).

Additionally, the study highlights that the substitution of H95 in KRAS with L and Q in NRAS and HRAS, respectively, further emphasizes the evolutionary divergence that influences selectivity for pan-KRAS inhibition. Other residues, including N116, K117, and D119 in the G4 motif, as well as S145, A146, and K147 in the G5 motif, are also discussed in the context of their roles in drug-binding and selectivity constraints for KRAS inhibition (kim2023pankrasinhibitordisables pages 3-4). 

Overall, these findings underscore the importance of specific amino acid residues in determining the efficacy and selectivity of pan-KRAS inhibitors.","95, 121, 122",Same,0.87234339257237,CORRECT,y,1,1
Which pathway(s) is primarily responsible for translation initiation of multitail mRNAs?,"The primary pathway responsible for translation initiation of multitail mRNAs is the cap-dependent translation mechanism. This process involves the assembly of the translation initiation complex around the m7G cap, facilitated by eukaryotic translation initiation factors (eIFs), particularly eIF4E and eIF4G. The interaction of eIF4G with cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding proteins (PABPCs) stabilizes this complex by recognizing the 3′ poly(A) tail, which is crucial for efficient protein production (chen2024branchedchemicallymodified pages 1-2).

However, the translation initiation of multitail mRNAs does not solely depend on the canonical eIF4E1/eIF4G1 pathway. Evidence from siRNA knockdown experiments indicates that the depletion of eIF4E1 and eIF4G1 has minimal effects on protein expression, suggesting the involvement of compensatory homologous genes such as eIF4E2 and eIF4G2/eIF4G3 or activation of noncanonical translation initiation pathways (chen2024branchedchemicallymodified pages 4-5). Additionally, multitail mRNAs exhibit enhanced translatability even under conditions where eIF4E–eIF4G interactions are limited, as indicated by a smaller reduction in translation when treated with the inhibitor 4EGI-1 (chen2024branchedchemicallymodified pages 5-6). Thus, multitail mRNAs may utilize alternative mechanisms for translation initiation alongside the canonical pathway.",eIF4E-eIF4G,Same,0.7,INCORRECT,y,0,1
Which poly(A) oligo(s) demonstrates highest resistance to RNA degredation?,"The poly(A) oligos demonstrating the highest resistance to RNA degradation are the branched chemically modified constructs, particularly those with multitail configurations. Among the tested constructs, the 'end modified 30A stem oligo + end modified 30A branches' exhibited the greatest stability against RNA degradation, attributed to its chemical modifications, including six phosphorothioate (PS) modifications at the 3′ end and terminal dideoxycytidine (chen2024branchedchemicallymodified pages 20-24).

Additionally, the study found that multitail poly(A) oligos significantly enhanced resistance to degradation, with a luminescence half-life (t1/2) of 16.8 ± 1.2 hours, compared to 9.7 ± 0.4 hours for chemically modified single tails and 7.0 ± 0.2 hours for unmodified tails (chen2024branchedchemicallymodified pages 4-5). The multitail constructs also demonstrated stronger binding to poly(A)-binding protein cytoplasmic 1 (PABPC1), indicating enhanced stability and functionality (chen2024branchedchemicallymodified pages 4-5).

Overall, the combination of chemical modifications and topological branching in these poly(A) oligos contributes to their superior resistance to RNA degradation, making them promising candidates for enhancing mRNA stability and translation (chen2024branchedchemicallymodified pages 1-2).",modified branch poly(A),Same,0.847508092039604,CORRECT,y,1,1

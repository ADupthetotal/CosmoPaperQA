Active olfactory receptor genes increase their contacts with greek island regions by what factor in mouse olfactory neurons?,"The context provided does not explicitly state the factor by which active olfactory receptor (OR) genes increase their contacts with Greek island (GI) regions in mouse olfactory neurons. However, the references and descriptions suggest that these interactions are highly specific and essential for OR transcription, involving the formation of a nucleoprotein complex (GI hub) mediated by transcription factors and coactivators.

For a precise quantitative answer, you would need to consult the cited studies, particularly those involving Hi-C or other chromatin conformation capture techniques (e.g., references 11, 12, or 13). These studies likely provide experimental data on the fold increase in contacts between active OR genes and GI regions.

"Are enhancer and promoter sequences broadly compatible in human cells, and is this the same as in drosophila?","Based on the provided context, the answer to the query is as follows:

In human cells, enhancer and promoter sequences appear to be broadly compatible, as the ExP STARR-seq assay results suggest that most enhancers activate all promoters by similar amounts, and their activities combine multiplicatively to determine RNA output. This indicates a general compatibility between enhancers and promoters in human K562 cells.

However, in *Drosophila*, studies have shown that there is some degree of intrinsic specificity between enhancers and promoters. For example, developmental and housekeeping gene promoters exhibit greater than tenfold preferences for different classes of genomic enhancers, and they respond differently to enhancer activation and recruitment of various cofactors. This suggests that enhancer-promoter compatibility in *Drosophila* is more selective compared to the broader compatibility observed in human cells.

Thus, while human enhancers and promoters seem broadly compatible, *Drosophila* shows more specificity in enhancer-promoter interactions.","yes, no",Similar,0.842987773555919,CORRECT,y,1,1

Does targeting sgRNAs to coding strands or template strands in gene bodies lead to higher effect size on average across multiple CRISPRi screens?,"Based on the provided context, targeting sgRNAs to the **coding strands** in gene bodies leads to a higher effect size on average across multiple CRISPRi screens.

1. In all 17 CRISPRi screens analyzed, the average effect sizes of sgRNAs targeting the coding strands within gene bodies were **more than twofold higher** than those targeting the template strands (Fig. 6d).
2. This strand bias was observed consistently in the GATA1, FADS1, and FADS2 CRISPRi screens, where coding strand-targeting sgRNAs had significantly greater effects (P < 1 × 10⁻¹³).
3. The effect was uniform throughout the transcribed gene body and ended at the transcription end site (TES).

Expression of human mu-opioid receptor (HsMOR) with an N-terminal yeast αPrePro sequence has what effect on yeast cell phenotype?,"Based on the provided context, the addition of an N-terminal yeast αPrePro sequence to the human mu-opioid receptor (HsMOR) is expected to improve its expression and localization in yeast cells. Specifically, the αPrePro sequence is a signal peptide that mediates ER (endoplasmic reticulum) insertion, which can increase the speed of ER insertion and minimize misfolding of the receptor. This is likely to enhance the functional expression of HsMOR in yeast, potentially leading to better agonist binding and improved utility in yeast-based screening assays.

However, the context does not explicitly state the observed phenotypic effects on yeast cells (e.g., growth, viability, or biosensor functionality). The primary focus is on improving receptor expression and localization, which could indirectly support the development of a functional HsMOR-based biosensor in yeast.

The context states that the chimeric receptors (which include A₂AAR with grafted ECL3 from A₃AR) did not show increased binding to the endogenous ligand adenosine but gained the ability to bind CF101 and CF102 with increased efficacy or potency. This suggests that the ECL3 region from A₃AR confers selective recognition and binding properties for these antagonists when introduced into other adenosine receptor subtypes.

How do microstimulations in the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex of monkeys in a prior experiment affect decision-making in later decision-making experiments?,"Based on the provided context, microstimulation of the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) in macaque monkeys induced a **negative bias in conflict decision-making**, specifically in approach-avoidance tasks. This was accompanied by an increase in skin conductance, suggesting effects on cardiovascular activity.

In later decision-making experiments (such as the approach-avoidance conflict task), this negative bias likely persists, influencing the monkeys' decisions by making them more inclined to avoid rather than approach, reflecting heightened negative processing. This effect has been observed in both humans and non-human primates, indicating that sgACC stimulation consistently alters decision-making toward a more cautious or avoidance-oriented behavior.

How do the human SNVs French 2 and Indian 2 affect the affinity of the transcription factor ETS-1 to DNA?,"Based on the provided context, the human single nucleotide variants (SNVs) French 2 and Indian 2 both result in the same phenotype (polydactyly) and are associated with a subtle increase in the affinity of the ETS-A site for the transcription factor ETS-1. Specifically:

1. Both variants lead to an ETS-A site with an affinity of approximately 0.25.
2. The increased affinity is validated by EMSA (electrophoretic mobility shift assay), which shows no significant difference in ETS-1 binding between the French 2, Indian 2, and the synthetically created Syn 0.25 sequences (all with ~0.25 affinity).

Thus, the French 2 and Indian 2 SNVs increase the affinity of ETS-1 to the ETS-A site in DNA, likely contributing to the polydactyly phenotype.

"If implementing symmetric molecular dynamics as a holonomic constraint, how can Wyckoff sites be constrained?","Based on the provided context, Wyckoff sites can be constrained in symmetric molecular dynamics by enforcing that the position vector \( \mathbf{q}_{in}(t) \) remains in a Wyckoff position at all times. This is achieved using a holonomic constraint defined by the equation:

\[
\sigma[\mathbf{q}(t)] = P \mathbf{q}(t) - \mathbf{q}(t) = \mathbf{0}
\]

where \( P \) is a symmetry operator (e.g., a group action) that maps the position to its symmetric equivalent. The constraint ensures that the position \( \mathbf{q}(t) \) is invariant under the symmetry operation \( P \).

The force from this constraint is given by:

\[
\mathbf{F}_c = \lambda (P - I)
\]

where \( \lambda \) is a Lagrange multiplier determined by the condition that the constraint must hold at the next time step, i.e., \( \sigma[\mathbf{q}(t + \Delta t)] = 0 \). The Jacobian \( f[\sigma] \) of the constraint with respect to \( \mathbf{q}(t) \) is \( (P - I) \).

Practically, this means:
1. Only the asymmetric unit (the independent degrees of freedom) is integrated in the dynamics.
2. The positions of the remaining particles (constrained by symmetry) are set explicitly before computing forces, ensuring they adhere to the Wyckoff position constraints.
3. The system's degrees of freedom are reduced to \( D \times (n - 1) \), where \( n \) is the number of independent particles and \( D \) is the dimensionality.

This suggests that the deletion of Ifnar1 in microglia disrupts the IFN-I (type I interferon) signaling pathway, which in turn appears to decrease the interaction between these microglial components and post-synaptic terminals. Additionally, the context indicates that hippocampal Axl mRNA expression is positively correlated with post-synapse engulfment in 5XFAD mice, implying that the reduction in Axl/PSD95 and Gas6/PSD95 co-localization due to Ifnar1 deletion may also lead to decreased post-synaptic engulfment by microglia.

Specifically, the approach includes:

1. **Initialization by Symmetry Operations**: The protein complexes are initialized by applying symmetry operations to an initial protein structure. This ensures that the starting configuration adheres to the desired symmetry constraints.

2. **Symmetrization of Forces and Noise Terms**: During the sampling process, the forces \( F(\mathbf{X}) \) and the noise term \( \mathbf{R} \, \mathrm{d} \tilde{\mathbf{W}} \) are symmetrized. This is achieved by averaging the forces \( [F(\mathbf{X})]_{j} \) at symmetric positions, ensuring that the dynamics of the system respect the prescribed Euclidean symmetries.

By incorporating these steps, the method ensures that the generated protein complexes maintain the desired symmetry throughout the computational design process.

What effect does a F200Y mutation in fungal β-tubulin have on binding of the anti-fungal drug thiabendazole?,"Based on the provided context, the F200Y mutation in fungal β-tubulin confers resistance to thiabendazole (TBZ). This suggests that the mutation alters the binding site of TBZ, likely reducing its affinity or preventing effective binding, thereby making the fungal cells resistant to the drug.

The context mentions that three mutations (F200Y, E198A, and F167Y) in fungal and nematode β-tubulins are associated with TBZ resistance, implying that these residues are critical for TBZ binding. Thus, the F200Y mutation disrupts TBZ's ability to bind and inhibit β-tubulin, leading to resistance.

What effect does expression of the ATPase-deficient E251Q mutant of the Spindle E protein in silkworm cells have on the levels of the mature piwiRNAs piR1712 and piR2986?,"Based on the provided context, the expression of the ATPase-deficient Spn-E-EQ mutant (E251Q) in silkworm cells does not rescue the decrease in artificial Siwi-bound piRNAs (such as those produced by the piR1712 and piR2986 reporters) caused by Spn-E knockdown. Specifically:

1. **For piR1712 (or similar Siwi-bound piRNAs)**:
   - The wild-type Spn-E rescues the decrease in artificial Siwi-bound piRNA levels, but the EQ mutant does not (Fig 3E and EV3C). This suggests that the ATPase activity of Spn-E is required for the production of these piRNAs during the ping-pong cycle.

2. **For piR2986 (or similar piRNAs)**:
   - The context does not explicitly mention piR2986, but the general trend indicates that ATPase-deficient Spn-E-EQ fails to restore the levels of Siwi-bound piRNAs (e.g., piR1712-like piRNAs). Thus, it is likely that piR2986 would also not be rescued by the EQ mutant.

Additionally, the context mentions that the EQ mutant does not rescue the decrease in **A → S piRNAs** (Fig 2E and 2F), further supporting the requirement of Spn-E's ATPase activity for proper piRNA biogenesis.

In summary, the expression of the Spn-E-EQ mutant does not restore the levels of mature piwiRNAs like piR1712 and likely piR2986, indicating that ATPase activity is essential for their production.",Decrease,Same,1,CORRECT,n,0,0

What is the effect on KRAB domain function when it is concatenated with a domain that is poorly expressed?,"When the KRAB domain is concatenated with a poorly expressed domain, the KRAB function is ablated or inhibited at lower concentrations of doxycycline (e.g., $100 \mathrm{ng/mL}$). However, increasing the doxycycline concentration (e.g., to $1000 \mathrm{ng/mL}$) can restore some or full silencing function, depending on the specific domain. This suggests that the loss of KRAB function in these fusions is likely due to decreased protein abundance rather than an intrinsic loss of repressive activity.

For example:
- **KRAB-DHX16 OB_NTP**: Inhibited at $100 \mathrm{ng/mL}$ dox, but some silencing is restored at $1000 \mathrm{ng/mL}$ dox.
- **KRAB-BAZ1A DDT**: Inhibited at $100 \mathrm{ng/mL}$ dox, but full silencing is restored at $1000 \mathrm{ng/mL}$ dox.

What is the effect on firing rate of parvalbumin-expressing interneurons in the barrel cortex of adult mice when the SMAD1 is deleted?,"The effect on the firing rate of parvalbumin-expressing (PV) interneurons in the barrel cortex of adult mice when SMAD1 is deleted is a **significant reduction in firing rate**. This reduction is likely due to a decrease in input resistance in the SMAD1-deficient PV interneurons.

Key points from the context:
1. The firing rate of SMAD1-deficient PV interneurons was significantly reduced in adult mice (Fig. 5d-f and Extended Data Fig. 9a).
2. The reduction in firing frequency is attributed to a reduction in input resistance in the Smad1-deficient cells.

"When using protein language models to predict the effect of mutations in fitness of adeno-associated virus 2, does fine-tuning give a larger gain for the ESM2, T5, or Ankh models?","Based on the provided context, fine-tuning gives a larger gain for the **Ankh** models when predicting the effect of mutations in the fitness of adeno-associated virus 2 (AAV2).

The context explicitly states:
- *""Ankh gained significantly by fine-tuning only for the mutational landscape data (GFP, AAV and GB1: green in Fig. 1).""*
- For other models like ESM2 and T5, while fine-tuning generally improved performance, the gains were not specifically highlighted for AAV2, and some exceptions (e.g., ESM2-150M for stability prediction) were noted.

Which amino acids of yeast Rev7 are not important for its interaction with the MRX complex?,"Based on the provided context, the experiments focused on the importance of the C-terminal regions of ScRev7 for its interaction with the MRX subunits. Specifically:

1. Deletion of the C-terminal 42 amino acids (residues 203-245) resulted in loss of cell proliferation and growth, indicating this region is critical for interaction with MRX.
2. Deletion of the C-terminal 150-203 amino acids also abrogated yeast cell growth, further emphasizing the importance of the C-terminal region.

In contrast, the N-terminally truncated variants (Rev7-N1, Rev7-N2, Rev7-N3) showed robust cell growth, suggesting that the N-terminal regions are **not critical** for the interaction with the MRX complex.

Thus, the **N-terminal amino acids of yeast Rev7** (those removed in the N-terminal truncations) are not important for its interaction with the MRX complex. The exact residues are not specified in the text, but the N-terminal deletions did not disrupt the interaction, unlike the C-terminal deletions.",1-149,Same,0.962376752380777,CORRECT,n,0,0

Which of the following epigenetic changes can be expected when male valvular interstitial cells (VIC) are cultured on larger polystyrene nanoparticles gels but not on smaller polystyrene nanoparticles gels?,"Based on the provided context, the expected epigenetic changes when male valvular interstitial cells (VICs) are cultured on larger polystyrene nanoparticles (PS-NPs) gels (e.g., 2000 nm diameter) compared to smaller ones (e.g., 200 nm diameter) would be:

**Decreased methylation and altered acetylation states due to UTY demethylase activity.**

### Key Evidence from the Context:
1. **Particle Size and Methylation**: The text states that in male myofibroblasts, ""decreased methylation correlates with particle size and density,"" implying that larger particles (lower density or larger size) are associated with reduced methylation.
2. **UTY Demethylase Activity**: The context mentions that male-specific methylation and acetylation states may be modulated via *UTY* demethylase activity, suggesting a mechanistic link between particle size and epigenetic changes.
3. **Gender-Specific Response**: Female VICs did not show the same trend, indicating this effect is male-specific.

Thus, larger PS-NPs gels would likely lead to **decreased methylation** in male VICs, while smaller PS-NPs gels would not exhibit this effect as prominently. Acetylation changes may also occur but are less explicitly detailed in the provided text.

### Answer:
**Decreased methylation (and potentially altered acetylation) can be expected in male VICs cultured on larger polystyrene nanoparticle gels, but not on smaller ones.**",Increased acetylation relative to female VICs,Different,0.928432653096578,INCORRECT,n,1,1

Which of the following mutations in the native nanobody targeting the RBD of the spike domain of SARS-Cov-2 pulls the CDR2 loop closer to RBD in computational models?,"Based on the provided context, the mutations in the native nanobody that were analyzed for their interaction with the RBD of the SARS-CoV-2 spike domain include **R52D, G56H, S107Q, and S107R**. The context mentions that these mutants were targeting additional residues of the RBD compared to the native nanobody, but it does not explicitly state which mutation specifically pulls the **CDR2 loop closer to the RBD** in computational models.

However, since the **CDR2 loop** is part of the nanobody's complementarity-determining regions (CDRs), and the mutations were introduced in the CDRs during in silico affinity maturation, it is plausible that one of these mutations could affect the CDR2 loop's proximity to the RBD. Without additional details from the context or figures (e.g., Fig 3), we cannot definitively determine which mutation causes this effect.

If forced to infer from the given data, **G56H** (a mutation in the CDR2 region) might be a candidate, as glycine (G) to histidine (H) is a significant change that could alter loop conformation. However, this is speculative without further evidence.

1. **Pbs2 mutations can affect binding strength** with SH3 domains (e.g., Sho1's SH3 domain) and within the broader context of the Sho1 protein.
2. **The binding of the Pbs2 extended motif to non-SH3 residues** could explain changes in binding strength.
3. **Stereochemical adjustments or changes in SH3 binding loops** may also contribute to altered interactions.

Since the context does not provide specific mutations (e.g., point mutations, deletions, or insertions) that increase Pbs2's interaction with SH3, the answer cannot be determined from the given information alone.

The context explicitly states:
*""RlmB and RlmKL have functions in ribosome assembly independent of their modification activities.""*

Which of the following training characteristics within the target brain region could explain inter individual differences in clinical response to real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging neurofeedback in patients with major depressive disorder?,"Based on the provided context, the training characteristic within the target brain region that could explain interindividual differences in clinical response to real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging neurofeedback (rtfMRI-NF) in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) is:

**The ability to self-regulate left amygdala activity during neurofeedback training.**

The context highlights that participants with MDD were trained to regulate left amygdala activity through rtfMRI-NF, and while significant reductions in depressive symptoms were observed on average, there was variability in therapeutic outcomes among participants. This suggests that differences in how effectively individuals can modulate their amygdala activity during training may contribute to the observed interindividual variability in clinical response.

Other potential factors (not explicitly mentioned in the context but inferred from the study's goals) could include:
- Baseline amygdala activity levels.
- Consistency or stability of amygdala regulation during training.

Key points supporting this conclusion:
1. The text states that multitail mRNA uses **eIF4-eIF3** for translation initiation.
2. Knockdown (KD) of **eIF3D** (a component of the eIF3 complex) led to a dramatic reduction in translation for all constructs, indicating that eIF3 is essential for multitail mRNA translation, similar to regular mRNA.

What are the reasons for the systematic differences between the IllustrisTNG and the SIMBA suites in CAMELS?,"The systematic differences between the IllustrisTNG and SIMBA suites in CAMELS mainly arise from their different subgrid physics implementations. IllustrisTNG uses the AREPO code with its own set of baryonic physics models, while SIMBA employs GIZMO with a fundamentally different set of feedback prescriptions, including distinct approaches to stellar and AGN feedback. Additionally, changes in astrophysical parameters, such as ASN2, affect the two suites in opposite ways—indicating that the same parameter can influence the matter power spectrum and other galaxy properties differently. Further differences are due to varying design choices, such as how cosmic variance is incorporated and the different latin-hypercube setups used to vary parameters.","The reasons for the systematic differences in the gas power spectra, the baryon fractions and the halo temperatures are the different subgrid feedback implementations and effective feedback strengths; the different feedback implementations and parameter variations and cosmic variance, respectively.",Similar,0.597252922477604,CORRECT,y,1,1

In practice, they use two sets of simulations: one (the LH set) where cosmology, astrophysics, and the random seed are varied, and another (the CV set) designed to isolate the effects of cosmic variance by varying only the initial random seed. They then compute summary statistics (medians and the 16–84 percentile ranges) to assess the fraction of the total variation attributable to cosmic variance versus that from changes in the underlying parameters.",They compute the median and 16-84 percentiles of the IllustrisTNG LH and CV sets.,Same ,0.619777722291732,CORRECT,y,1,0
"In the ""Cosmology with one galaxy?"" paper, why are the trained models not robust?","The trained models are not robust because they become sensitive to the subgrid physics used in the simulation suites. Essentially, they learn features that are specific to the simulation on which they were trained (for example, IllustrisTNG) and do not generalize well when applied to galaxies from different simulations (like SIMBA) that use different subgrid models.

What are the main limitations of the CAMELS simulations?,"The main limitations of the CAMELS simulations are threefold. First, they have limited resolution—the mass and spatial resolution restricts them to scales above roughly 1 h⁻¹ kpc, and only halos with dark matter masses above a certain threshold (approximately 6.5 × 10⁹(h⁻¹ M☉ scaled by a cosmological factor)) are sufficiently resolved, making it impossible to study small-scale structures like sub-halos in detail. Second, the simulation volume is relatively small, at (25 h⁻¹ Mpc)³, which means that long wavelength modes crucial for the formation of large-scale structures (e.g., galaxy clusters) and for a proper normalization of the matter power spectrum are not captured. Third, CAMELS only varies a limited set of parameters—specifically, only two cosmological parameters and four astrophysical parameters—with some parameters (like Ωb in the magneto-hydrodynamic runs) held fixed, thereby restricting the exploration of separate effects and the full range of potential astrophysical variations.",The mass and spatial resolution in CAMELS does not allow for resolution of scales below \approx 1 h^{−1}kpc.

Why M31 have problems with being used as an anchor in the determination of H_0 in the HST paper?,"The HST paper identifies two main issues with using M31 as an anchor for determining H₀. First, the HST PHAT program did not include the F555W filter and did not gather time-series data, which means that the standard dereddening method using individual, mean-light F555W–F814W colors cannot be applied to M31 Cepheids. Instead, only F110W–F160W colors are available, which require recalibration to match the dereddening derived from ground-based V–I measurements—this introduces additional systematic uncertainties. Second, the DEB distance estimates for M31 are based on early-type stars whose distances rely on non‐LTE stellar model atmospheres, adding uncertainties that are difficult to assess. Together, these factors led the authors to conservatively remove M31 from the anchor set in their primary determination of H₀.","The PHAT HST program, which gathered the relevant data, did not use the F555W filter or include time-series data so the individual mean-light F555W-F814 colours cannot be used to deredden these Cephids.

How do the authors of the ACT DR6 paper constrain the effective number of relativistic species from the CMB power spectra?,"The authors use the sensitivity of the high‐multipole CMB power spectra (the TT, TE, and EE spectra) to the expansion history and the diffusion damping scale to constrain Neff. Changes in Neff affect the damping tail and induce a phase shift in the acoustic peaks, so by comparing the measured power spectra against theoretical models that treat Neff as a free parameter—and by including additional data such as CMB lensing and BAO—they are able to tightly constrain its value. Their analysis shows no evidence for excess damping beyond the ΛCDM prediction, leading to constraints such as Neff = 2.60^(+0.21)_(-0.29) or Neff = 2.73 ± 0.14 at 68% confidence, and setting an upper limit of Neff < 3.08 at 95% confidence.",N_{eff} alters the damping tail of the CMB power spectra and also induces a characteristic phase shift in the acoustic peaks.,Same,0.794990562330298,CORRECT,y,1,1

Why is there an apparent preference for A_L deviating from theoretical expectations in the Planck 2018 analysis?,"The Planck 2018 analysis shows an apparent preference for A_L > 1 because the temperature power spectrum displays a level of smoothing (or damping of the acoustic peaks) that is higher than what is predicted by the standard lensing reconstruction. In part, this comes from a lower optical depth (τ) measured in the 2018 analysis, which forces a lower amplitude of primordial fluctuations (A_s) to match the high-ℓ data. This, in turn, necessitates a larger A_L to produce a comparable smoothing effect. Additionally, oscillatory residuals observed in the multipole range ℓ ≃ 1100–2000—which may mimic an enhanced lensing effect—contribute to the preference. These residuals could be influenced by choices in sky area, foreground priors, or potential unaccounted-for systematics (as seen in frequency differences between channels). Finally, parameter degeneracies (notably between τ, Ω_mh², and nₛ) further drive this effect. When combined with Planck’s lensing reconstruction data, the inferred value of A_L moves closer to unity, suggesting that the observed A_L > 1 from the TT spectrum may largely be due to statistical fluctuations or specific analysis choices.","In temperature, over half of the small upward shift in A_L is explained by the lower optical depth from the 2018 low-l likelihood, In polarization, the shift in A_L is explained by changes in \tau, with changes in the maps, modelling for beam leakage, and polarization efficiencies.",Same,0.507382490901657,CORRECT,n,0,0
Why is there such a large difference between the optical and NIR Wesenheit magnitude systematic errors in the HST paper?,"The optical Wesenheit magnitudes have larger systematic errors largely because they are more sensitive to changes in factors such as reddening, metallicity, the treatment of period-luminosity relation breaks, and outlier rejection. In the optical, the larger value of R (the total-to-selective extinction ratio) makes these magnitudes especially sensitive to the reddening law, leading to a systematic error (2.8%) that is considerably larger than that for the near-infrared counterpart.","Changes to the treatment of reddening, metallicity, P–L relation breaks, and outlier rejection cause larger changes in H_0 for the optical than for the NIR Wesenheit magnitude calculations.",Same,0.797053904250566,CORRECT,y,1,1

"What are the constraints on both N_{eff} and \summ_{\nu} when both parameters are allowed to vary at the same time, with the P-ACT-LB dataset at the 95% CL?","Using the P‑ACT‑LB dataset at the 95% confidence level and allowing both parameters to vary simultaneously, the effective number of neutrino species is constrained to Neff = 2.85 ± 0.25, and the sum of neutrino masses is constrained to be less than 0.073 eV.","N_{eff}=2.85\pm0.25, \summ_{\nu}<0.073eV",Same,0.65,CORRECT,y,1,1
"In the ""Cosmology with one galaxy?"" paper, how do the authors test if the neural network uses information concerning dark matter in galaxies?","The authors test this by performing an ablation experiment. They train the neural network on galaxies from the IllustrisTNG simulations and then omit variables that are expected to be dominated by the dark matter component (specifically Vmax, σv, Mt, Rt, and Rmax). They observe that without these dark matter–related variables, the network’s ability to infer Ωm degrades dramatically (about 96% worse than the network trained on all properties). Additionally, removing the most important feature, Vmax, completely cancels the network’s constraining power. These experiments demonstrate that the network is indeed using information related to the dark matter content or gravitational potential of galaxies.","The authors trained networks on galaxies from the IllustrisTNG simulations using all properties except V_{max}, \sigma_{\nu}, M_t, R_t, and R_{max}, which are quantities that are expected to receive large contributions from the dark matter component of galaxies. The network trained with this configuration is still able to infer the value of \Omega_m but with much lower accuracy. Thus, the authors conclude that the network may be using information either about the dark matter content of the galaxy or about its gravitational potential well.

"In the ""Cosmology with one galaxy?"" paper, how is the direct comparison of the performance of the IllustrisTNG and the SIMBA simulations performed?","The paper performs the comparison by ranking the galaxy properties in order of their importance for model accuracy (measured via RMSE) for each simulation. In Figure 6, two panels are shown: one for IllustrisTNG and one for SIMBA. For each simulation, the properties are ordered from those that contribute most to the prediction accuracy to those that contribute the least. The horizontal bars indicate the RMSE achieved when only a given subset of variables is used, and the numbers inside the bars show the loss in accuracy relative to a model trained using all variables. For example, the IllustrisTNG model that uses only Vmax yields an RMSE of about 0.1 and performs 163.4% worse than the full model. In contrast, a SIMBA model that uses a selected subset of variables (Vmax, M∗, Rmax, Z∗, R∗) achieves an RMSE that is only 14.7% worse than its full model. This direct comparison through the ranking and associated RMSE deterioration (loss in accuracy) allows for a clear evaluation of the performance between the two simulations.","There is no correspondence between simulations among the IllustrisTNG and the SIMBA sets. Thus, a direct comparison between the two is not performed.",Same,0.688189933377307,CORRECT,n,0,0

Is there evidence of tensions between the Planck 2018 and the SPT determinations of cosmological parameters?,"Yes, there is evidence of tension between the Planck 2018 and SPT determinations of cosmological parameters. For instance, SPTpol results showed a greater than approximately 2σ tension with the base-ΛCDM model, with the parameters drifting away from the Planck solution at higher multipoles. Additionally, the fact that the SPT and Planck data (beyond l > 1000) cover similar ranges and yet disagree suggests that systematic errors could be contributing to these tensions, and may even play a role in the present discrepancies observed with local H₀ measurements.",No evidence for any statistically significant inconsistency between the Planck and the SPT cosmological parameters.,Different,0.751045830475619,INCORRECT,n,1,1
"With the symbolic regression, how do the authors of CAMELS prevent overly complicated functions for predicting the cosmological quantities being passed down the generations?","They prevent overly complicated functions by penalizing complexity in their symbolic regression. Specifically, each operator in the function set is assigned a complexity score (for example, basic operators like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division get a score of 1, while more complex operators like logarithms, exponentials, and absolute values are given a score of 2). This explicit complexity measure discourages the algorithm from selecting longer or overly sophisticated functions, ensuring that simpler, more generalizable expressions are favored.","Complexity is an integer number associated to each operator, which penalises more complex operations in the functions",Same,0.758661226088076,CORRECT,y,1,1
